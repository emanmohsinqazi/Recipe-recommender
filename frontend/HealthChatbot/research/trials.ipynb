I know from \\nfirst hand experience that diet plays a very big part in any \\nfitness programme as well as sporting success. When I \\nwas training for the Olympics, I would eat a lot of food – a \\ntypical week would include more than twenty hours in the \\npool as well as ten in the gym – so I was always hungry. But, \\nto be the best in my sport, I made sure that I ate a lot of the \\nright foods, as well as trained very hard. I won an Olympic \\nsilver medal, double Commonwealth gold, competed in \\nthree Olympics in three decades, as well as set 200 British \\nrecords. I now work for the BBC as a presenter on swimming \\namong other things. \\n Although I no longer compete, I am still committed \\nto a fitness regime. These days I basically exercise to stay \\nin shape – regularly working out in my home gym, skiing, \\nwalking the dog and playing with my kids – but I still pay \\nattention to what I eat. I don’t diet, I’ve tried them, they \\ndon’t work for me, I just eat healthily, balancing what I eat \\nwith my activity needs. When I eat well, I have more energy \\nand I perform a lot better too. It’s simple really, calories in \\nequals calories out – or you put on weight!\\n I’ve known Anita for several years and always shared \\nher practical approach to nutrition. I welcome this book, \\nit combines the best of nutrition knowledge with fitness \\ntraining and an active lifestyle. It gives you clear no-\\nnonsense advice about what to eat, how much to eat and \\nwhen to eat. There are hundreds of useful facts and tips \\nto help you put together a healthy eating plan, whether \\nyou are working out for fitness or in serious training for \\ncompetitions. I’m sure that you will find this book useful \\nand a great investment in your well-being. \\nSharron Davies mbe \\nOlympic Swimming Champion\\n00FFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   4 19/12/2013   22:45\\nwww.ebook3000.com'),\n",

If you’re already an \\naccomplished athlete, this book will help you reach the \\nnext level. If you’re new to fitness, then this book will give \\nyou a head start and you’ll begin reaping the benefits \\nstraight away. \\n Getting your nutrition right is perhaps more important \\nthan the training you do if you want to maximise your \\nfit ness. After all, performance starts with fuelling, not \\ntraining! Correct nutrition will enable you to train harder \\nand more effectively, recover quicker, miss fewer sessions \\nthrough illness, injury or fatigue, and gain a competitive \\nedge. Without it, you will not be making the most of your \\ntraining. \\n In this 4th edition of Food For Fitness, you will learn how \\nto fuel your training programme effectively, how to time \\nyour nutritional intake for fastest results, what the best \\nrecovery foods are, and which supplements really work. \\nYou’ll also discover how to achieve your ideal weight, how \\nto gain muscle, lose fat and create the perfect diet for your \\nfitness programme or sport. You’ll find core eating plans for \\nrunners, cyclists, swimmers, triathletes, and team players, \\nas well as eating strategies for competitions that will help \\nyou achieve your best performance.\\n This 4th edition represents the most up-to-date advice \\non nutrition for sport and exercise. Since the publication of \\nthe 3rd edition of Food For Fitness, there have been hundreds \\nof new studies and scientific discoveries that have changed \\nthe dietary advice I give to athletes, particularly on topics \\nsuch as carbohydrate requirements, fat and sugar. There’s \\nalso been a shift in the scientific consensus on hydration, \\nnutrient timing and protein intake. I’ve incorporated the \\nlatest science into this new edition, giving you all the most \\ncutting-edge information on nutrition and fitness at your \\nfingertips.\\n I’m a firm believer in evidence-based advice so in \\nthis book, you’ll find that all the facts are supported \\nby referenced sources at the end of each chapter. I’ve \\nendeavoured to present current, useful and practical \\nadvice to help you improve your performance, not \\npersonal opinions, anecdotes or cherry-picked evidence \\nto promote a personal view. I should point out that I don’t \\nsell products or supplements so you can be assured that \\nthe advice in this book is unbiased and scientifically-based. \\nBy demystifying the hype and hearsay, this book will save \\nyou time, effort and money – you won’t be eating foods or \\nsupplements that you don’t need. \\n Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working with \\nmany athletes in different sports and have learnt that \\nnutrition really can make a big difference to everyone’s per-\\nfor mance, whether a newcomer, club athlete or Olympian. \\nBut that can only happen when the individual has the \\nmeans to put the theory (about nutrients) into practice \\n(daily diet). In other words, you need to know exactly \\nwhat meals and snacks to eat! And in Part 3  I’ve devised \\nover 50 delicious fitness recipes for breakfasts, main meals \\nand snacks. They’re all quick and simple to make, healthy, \\ninexpensive and best of all require minimal cooking skills! \\n Good luck and happy cooking and training!\\nAnita Bean\\n2014\\nintRodUCtion\\n00FFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   5 19/12/2013   22:45\\nwww.ebook3000.com'),\n",

Energy (calories)\\nWhere do I get energy?\\nYou get energy from four components in food and drink: carbohydrate, fat, \\nprotein and (though not strictly a nutrient) alcohol. Each of these provides \\ndifferent amounts of energy. 1 g provides approximately:\\n protein  4 kcal (17 kJ) alcohol  7 kcal (29 kJ)\\n carbohydrate  4 kcal (17 kJ) fat  9 kcal (38 kJ)\\nThese fuels are broken down in your body and transformed via various bio\\xad\\nchemical pathways into a compound called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Energy \\nis produced when one of the phosphate molecules splits off, leaving adenosine \\ndiphosphate (ADP). This energy can then be used to fuel your muscles.\\nHow many calories do I need?\\nYou can estimate your daily calorie needs by working out your basal metabolic \\nrate (BMR) and multiplying it by your physical activity level. \\n Your BMR is the number of calories you burn at rest over 24 hours main\\xad\\ntaining essential functions such as respiration, digestion and brain function. BMR \\naccounts for 60–75 per cent of the calories you burn daily.\\nYour diet not only affects your health but also your \\nperformance. It affects how energetic you feel, \\nyour stamina, your strength and your power. It is \\nundoubtedly the biggest factor when it comes to \\nbody weight and body composition, both of which \\nare critical for peak performance (as well as health). \\nWhat, how much, and when you eat can also make \\na crucial difference to your ability to recover after \\nexercise as well as your performance in competition. \\nSo, whether you’re exercising for fitness or training for \\ncompetitions, eating a healthy diet and maintaining \\nproper hydration will help improve your performance, \\nkeep you healthy and promote fast recovery. \\nExactly what should you eat then? Well, there’s \\nno ‘ideal diet’ that’s right for everyone but a good \\nplace to start when it comes to designing your daily \\ndiet are the guidelines developed by the Intern\\xad\\national Olympic Committee (IOC, 2011) and the \\nACSM (Rodrigues et al., 2009). These form the basis \\nof the nutrition advice in this chapter. However, your \\nexact calorie and nutritional needs will depend on \\nyour weight, size, age, daily calorie expenditure, indi\\xad\\nvidual metabolism, training programme and even \\nsuch factors as the temperature and humidity. To help \\nyou make the healthiest food choices, here are the \\nessential facts about nutrition for sport and exercise.\\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   3 19/12/2013   22:35'),\n",

Carbohydrate are an important fuel for muscles – almost \\nall types of activities rely on carbohydrate (glucose) for energy. Perhaps the \\nonly exception is a single all\\xadout lift in the gym or a single jump. But sprinting, \\nrunning, jogging, swimming, cycling, walking, playing football … they all use \\ncarbohydrate to a greater or lesser degree. The longer and harder you exercise, \\nthe more carbohydrate you burn. \\n So, the main purpose of carbohydrate is to fuel the muscles. It’s also the \\npreferred fuel for the brain, nervous system and heart, which use about 130 \\ng daily, although it is possible to survive on less than this, perhaps as little as \\n50\\xa0g. That’s because the body can make glucose from protein in a process called \\ngluconeogenesis. If you eat less than this amount (this is not recommended for \\nathletes), then your body will go into a state of ketosis. This means that fats are \\nconverted into ketone bodies in the liver, which can then be used by the brain for \\nfuel instead of glucose. However, they cannot provide fuel for the muscles, which \\nis why low\\xadcarbohydrate diets are not generally advised for athletes. \\nCan I over-consume carbohydrate?\\nThe carbohydrate in your food is converted into glycogen and stored in your liver \\nand muscles. However, these stores are relatively small – you can store only about \\n100 g (equivalent to 400 calories) in the liver and 400 g (or 1,600 calories) in the \\nmuscles. Once your glycogen stores are ‘full’ , then your body will convert any \\nexcess carbohydrate to fat. So, while it is important to refill your glycogen stores \\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   5 19/12/2013   22:35'),\n",

Just as over\\xadfilling the fuel tank \\nin your car won’t make it go faster, over\\xadconsuming carbohydrate won’t improve \\nyour performance. Excess carbohydrate can mean excess fat weight, which will \\nalmost certainly hinder your performance. \\nCan I eat too little carbohydrate?\\nOn the other hand, consuming a low \\xadcarbohydrate diet or exercising with low \\nglycogen stores can result in early fatigue, reduced stamina and poor performance, \\nparticularly for high\\xadintensity endurance activities lasting longer than an hour. If \\nyou eat too little carbohydrate after training, your recovery will be impaired and, \\nover time, you may develop symptoms of over training. Therefore, it’s important \\nthat you plan your carbohydrate intake around your training sessions carefully to \\navoid weight gain as well as under\\xadperformance. \\nHow much carbohydrate do I need?\\nA high\\xadcarbohydrate diet has long been the cornerstone of nutrition advice for all \\nregular exercisers. However, scientific thinking around how much carbohydrate \\nyou need has shifted since the publication of the 3rd edition of Food for Fitness in \\nfavour of a higher fat intake and lower\\xadcarbohydrate intake, particularly for those \\ntrying to lose weight. \\n Previously, sports scientists recommended that everyone should get around \\n60 per cent of their calories from carbohydrate. However this doesn’t take account \\nof different exercise modes (endurance or anaerobic), body weights or training \\nvolumes. One size doesn’t fit all! The quantity of carbohydrate you should eat \\ndepends on your goals (e.g. to lose, maintain or gain weight), how much exercise \\nyou do, the type and intensity of your activity and your body weight. Also, for \\nmost people, the amount of activity you do varies from day to day, so you will \\nneed to vary your carbohydrate intake accordingly. For instance, on days when \\nyou are more active, you should eat more carbohydrate; conversely, on rest days \\nor when you do a lighter workout, you should eat less carbohydrate.\\n As a rule of thumb, the longer and harder you train, the more carbohydrate \\nyou need to fuel your muscles (Rodrigues et al., 2009; IOC, 2011). The Australian \\nInstitute of Sport recommend that those who do relatively low\\xadintensity exercise, \\nsuch as brisk walking, slow jogging or skill \\xadbased workouts, consume 3–5 g \\ncarbohydrate/kg of body weight daily (Burke, L., 2007; Burke et al., 2011). If \\nyou do moderate \\xadintensity training, such as cycling, swimming or running, for \\nan hour a day, then you should aim to consume 5–7 g/kg of body weight daily. \\nDoing moderate\\xad to high \\xadintensity training up to 3 hours a day increases your \\nhow cAn i tEll if i AM \\nEAting too Much or too \\nlittlE cArBohydrAtE?\\nA good guide as to whether you \\nare eating enough carbohydrate is \\nhow energetic you feel during your \\nworkouts. If you feel easily fatigued \\nbut haven’t changed the amount \\nof rest and sleep you get, nor \\nincreased your training volume, this \\nmay suggest low glycogen levels \\nand an insufficient carbohydrate \\nintake. Upping your carbohydrate \\nintake by an extra 50–100 g daily \\nshould restore glycogen levels and \\nstave off fatigue. However, over-\\neating carbohydrate won’t increase \\nyour energy levels. Instead, you \\nmay feel ‘heavy’ and, ironically, \\nmore lethargic. Once your glycogen \\nstores are filled, excess carbo-\\nhydrate is converted into fat so you \\nmay notice that you put on weight. \\nTry to listen to your body and you’ll \\nsoon find the balance between too \\nlittle and too much carbohydrate.\\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   6 19/12/2013   22:35'),\n",

Performance\\nWhen it comes to performance, sugar can be useful for maintaining blood \\nglucose concentrations during intense training sessions or events lasting more \\nthan 60 minutes when the muscles may run low on glycogen and need extra \\nfuel quickly. In these scenarios, consuming sugar (say, in the form of a banana, \\ndried fruit, a sports drink, or a cereal bar) would help you continue exercising \\nlonger and/or maintain your intensity, i.e. perform to your potential. However, \\nit would be unnecessary for shorter sessions. Sugar may also be beneficial for \\nrefuelling muscles during the 2\\xadhour period after exercise (see page 10). \\n But eating more sugar won’t necessarily make you feel more energetic \\nor ‘give you more energy’ . In fact, the opposite holds true – consuming sugar \\nbefore exercise does not improve performance or stamina and may even result \\nin hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) if you consume too much or get the \\ntiming wrong (Burke et al., 1998; Wu and Williams, 2006). Eating sugar triggers \\ninsulin release, which rapidly transports glucose out of the bloodstream. If \\nyou eat too much before exercising or your body produces too much insulin \\nafter eating sugar, then you may be left with lower blood glucose levels than \\nbefore. This rebound effect can make you feel tired, weak and lightheaded. It \\nis ‘safer’ to eat a low\\xadGI meal 2–4 hours before exercise or consume only small \\namounts of sugar (e.g. a banana) if you need an energy boost before exercise. \\n2. health\\nAccording to an analysis of 68 studies commissioned by the World Health \\nOrgani zation (WHO), sugar (not simply calories) is a principal cause of the \\nobesity epidemic (Morenga et al., 2013). High intakes of sugar have been linked \\nwith type 2 diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, \\nhigh triglyceride levels, cardiovascular disease, cancer and dementia. One \\nstudy found that for every 150 calories from sugar there is an 11\\xadfold increase \\nin type 2 diabetes risk (Basu et al., 2013). \\n It’s not just the high calorie content of sugary foods and drinks that is \\nthought to cause these problems but also the specific actions of fructose \\nthat makes up half of sugar (sucrose is half glucose, half fructose). Fructose \\nencourages fat storage more than any other nutrient. When you eat fructose \\nit goes to the liver where it may be converted to glycogen or fat. If liver \\nglycogen (stored carbohydrate) is low, such as after a long exercise session, \\nfructose will be used to replenish it. But if your liver is already full of glycogen, \\nthen fructose will be stored as fat. So, unless you have just done intense \\nexercise, any fructose that you eat will be converted to fat. In other words, it’s \\nvery easy to get fat from eating sugar. \\nQ&A\\nHow much sugar is ‘safe’ to eat? \\nThere’s no simple answer. Some people \\ncan eat sugar without harm while others \\nshould avoid it. According to the WHO \\nand UK guidelines, you should get no \\nmore than 10 per cent of your daily \\ncalories from added sugars, which \\nequates to about 50 g for the average \\nperson consuming 2,000 calories a day. \\nBut the US guidelines recommend no \\nmore than 25 g for women and 38 g for \\nmen (Johnson et al., 2009). To put that \\ninto perspective, one 330 ml can of coke \\ncontains 35 g of sugar while a Kit Kat \\ncontains 23 g of sugar. \\n The GDA that appears on food labels \\nis 120 g for men and 90 g for women, \\nbut these figures are confusing as they \\ninclude both naturally occurring (e.g. \\nfruit and milk) and added sugars. Some \\nscientists believe the GDA is set too high \\n(Malhotra, 2013).\\niS SugAr good or BAd for \\nAthlEtES?\\nSugar is a carbo hydrate, which means it \\nis an energy source for the body. It can \\nbe used to fuel muscles during exercise; \\nconvert into glycogen; or turn into fat. \\nThe dilemma for athletes is knowing \\nwhen sugar may be useful for perfor-\\nmance or when it may be harmful for \\nhealth.\\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   9 19/12/2013   22:35'),\n",

Unlike glucose, it doesn’t trigger leptin (the \\nhormone that signals the brain that you’re full) or reduce the hunger hormone \\nghrelin. It has no effect on satiety.\\n If you’re active, moderate amounts of sugar won’t do any harm as you’ll \\nprobably burn these calories off through exercise. But it’s important to remember \\nthere’s no physiological need for added sugars in the diet – they don’t serve any \\npurpose apart from fuel (calories). The less you eat, the healthier you’ll be.\\n If its sweetness you want, then it’s better to get sugar from natural sources \\nsuch as fruit and vegetables. Here, they are locked into the structure of the food, \\nwhich makes them far less harmful to health than ‘added sugar’ . That’s because \\nthe sugars are much less concentrated in fruit and vegetables and also because \\nfibre slows the absorption of sugar. This means you don’t get a sharp rise in blood \\nsugar and insulin. Less insulin means less fat storage. Also, these foods are very \\ndifficult to over\\xadeat. \\n On balance, athletes and regular exercisers need not be over \\xadconcerned \\nabout sugar. Small amounts are unlikely to do you any harm and provided you \\ntime your sugar intake around exercise, it may even aid your performance. Ideally, \\nopt for sources that also provide other nutrients, for example bananas and other \\nfruit. While fruit juice and smoothies contain more vitamins, they contain a similar \\namount of sugar to soft drinks (around 10 g/100 ml), which is rapidly absorbed, \\nmeaning they are not necessarily a healthier option. Here are some general rules: \\n■ During training sessions lasting more than 60 minutes, consuming squash, \\ndiluted fruit juice and sports drinks, bananas, dried fruit or cereal bars will help \\nfuel tiring muscles and improve your endurance. \\n■ After intense exercise lasting more than 60 minutes, you’ll need carbo hydrate \\nto re\\xadstock your glycogen, so sugar in flavoured milk, yoghurt, milkshakes or \\nbars can be useful. \\n■ At other times, if you want something sweet, opt for foods that contain fibre \\n(to mitigate the rise in blood glucose) and other nutrients: fresh fruit, dried \\nfruit, yoghurt, dried fruit and nut bars, or granola bars.\\n■ Drink water or milk as a rule, although other unsweetened drinks such as tea \\nand coffee also count towards hydration. \\nSimple or complex carbohydrate?\\nCarbohydrate are traditionally classified as simple (mono \\xad or disaccharides) \\nor complex (polysaccharides) according to the number of sugar units in the \\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   10 19/12/2013   22:35'),\n",

But this tells you very little about their effect on your body and your \\nblood glucose level. Nowadays, carbohydrate are more commonly categorised \\naccording to their glycaemic index (GI).\\nWhat is the glycaemic index (GI)?\\nThe GI was developed by David Jenkins in 1982. He discovered that, contrary \\nto popular belief, many starchy foods affected blood glucose levels quite \\ndramatically, while some sugary foods had little effect. \\n The GI is a ranking of foods from 0 to 100 based on their immediate effect on \\nblood sugar levels. It’s a measure of how quickly the food turns into glucose in the \\nbloodstream. To make a fair comparison, all foods are ranked against a reference \\nfood, normally glucose, and are tested in equivalent carbohydrate amounts. \\nGlucose has a GI score of 100.\\n High\\xadGI foods cause a rapid rise in blood glucose levels and have a GI number \\nabove 70 (glucose has the highest score at 100). They include refined starchy \\nfoods such as potatoes, cornflakes, white bread and white rice as well as sugary \\nfoods such as soft drinks, biscuits and sweets.\\n Foods classed as low\\xadGI foods fall below 55 and produce a slower and smaller \\nrise in blood glucose levels. They include beans, lentils, coarse \\xadgrain breads, \\nmuesli, fruit and dairy products. Moderate \\xadGI foods such as porridge, rice and \\nsweet potatoes have a GI between 55 and 70.\\n Protein\\xadrich foods such as meat, fish, chicken and eggs and pure fats such as \\noils, butter and margarine contain no carbohydrate so these foods have no GI \\nvalue. But adding these foods to meals will slow the digestion and absorption of \\ncarbohydrate from the gut, and thus reduce the GI of the entire meal. Cooking \\nand ripening (of fruits) tends to increase the GI value.\\nSo which carbohydrate when?\\nYou can use the GI value of foods to help you plan what to eat and drink around \\nyour training session or competition. In general, high\\xadGI foods and drinks are \\nuseful during moderate \\xad to high \\xadintensity exercise lasting longer than an hour. \\nAs they are digested rapidly, they help maintain blood glucose levels and provide \\nreadily available fuel for your muscles. Similarly, after exercise, high\\xadGI foods and \\ndrinks will help restore muscle glycogen stores faster, particularly when combined \\nwith protein in a ratio of approximately 3 to 1 (see page 49). Before exercise, it is \\nbest to consume a low \\xadGI meal about 2–4 hours beforehand as this will provide \\na more sustained rise in blood glucose. Alternatively, a high \\xadGI snack consumed \\nabout 30 minutes before exercise will help maintain blood glucose longer during \\nyour workout (there’s more about this in Chapter 2).  \\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   11 19/12/2013   22:35'),\n",

That is because blood glucose response is also determined by \\nthe amount of food eaten. The glycaemic load (GL) gives you a more accurate idea \\nof how a food behaves in your body. Unlike GI, it takes account of the portion size \\n(i.e. the number of carbohydrate you are eating), so can be regarded as a measure \\nof both the quantity and quality of the carbohydrate.\\n It is calculated as follows:\\n GL = (GI x carbohydrate per portion) ÷ 100\\nOne unit of GL is roughly equivalent to the glycaemic effect of 1 g of glucose.\\n An example for watermelon:\\nGL = (72 × 6) x 100 = 4.3\\ngi value gl value daily gl total\\nLow 0–55 0–10 0–80\\nMedium 56–70 11–19 80–120\\nHigh 71–100 > 20  >120\\nFor optimal glycogen storage and minimal fat storage, aim to achieve a small or \\nmoderate glycaemic load – eat little and often, avoid overloading on carbohydrate, \\nand stick to balanced combinations of carbohydrate, protein and fat.\\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   13 19/12/2013   22:35'),\n",

For example, watermelon with a \\nGI of 72 – classified as a high\\xadGI food – is off the menu on a low\\xadGI diet. However, \\nan average slice (120 g/4.2 oz) provides only 6 g of carbohydrate – not enough \\nto raise your blood glucose level significantly. You would need to eat 720 g of \\nwatermelon to obtain 50 g of carbohydrate – the amount used in the GI test. \\n Another drawback is that some high \\xadfat foods have a low GI, which gives it a \\nfalsely favourable impression. For example, crisps have a lower GI (54) than baked \\npotatoes (85). But they are easy to over\\xadeat because they are not very filling.\\nCan GI help weight loss?\\nFoods with a low GI are generally more nutritious than higher \\xadGI foods, but to \\nlose weight you still have to consume fewer calories than you burn. In theory, \\na low\\xadGI diet should be filling and satisfying because many foods with a low GI \\nare high in fibre and take longer to digest, thus helping to curb your appetite. In \\npractice, it’s quite easy to unwittingly load up on calories. Muesli (GI 49), boiled \\npotatoes (GI 50), spaghetti (GI 48) and sponge cake (GI 46) are all low\\xadGI foods, \\nbut are also relatively high in calories. Even milk chocolate has low GI (43), but \\nprovides as many as 240 calories (1,004 kJ) per 45 g bar!\\n There have been no long \\xadterm studies, but of the short \\xadterm studies to date \\nonly about half have found that low \\xadGI foods reduce hunger, increase satiety \\n(feelings of fullness) or reduce overall food intake. No difference in satiety or \\nfood intake was found in the remaining half. A study published in the American \\nJournal of Clinical Nutrition in 2004 found that weight loss on a low\\xadGI diet was no \\ndifferent to that on a high\\xadGI diet (Sloth, 2004). Clearly, you still have to keep a rein \\non portion sizes and reduce carbohydrate. \\n3. fibre\\nWhy do you need fibre?\\nFibre is the term used to describe the complex carbohydrate found in plants \\nthat are resistant to digestion. There are two kinds of fibre – insoluble and \\nsoluble. Most plant foods contain both, but proportions vary. Good sources of \\ninsoluble fibre include whole grains, such as wholegrain bread, pasta and rice \\nand vegetables. These help to speed the passage of food through your gut, and \\nprevent constipation and bowel problems. Soluble fibre, found in oats, beans, \\nlentils, nuts, fruit and vegetables, reduces LDL cholesterol levels and helps \\ncontrol blood glucose levels by slowing glucose absorption. High\\xadfibre foods are \\nbeneficial for weight loss as they fill you up and promote satiety.\\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   15 19/12/2013   22:35'),\n",

The average intake in the UK is around 13–14\\xa0g/\\nday, which is considerably less than the 80–130\\xa0g eaten daily by our ancestors \\n5,000 years ago (according to estimates by scientists at the Paleobiotic Laboratory \\nin New Orleans, USA).\\n4. Protein\\nProtein is made up of amino acids joined together in a chain. The body makes \\nsome of these amino acids; however, there are some that it cannot make and that \\ntherefore need to be consumed in the diet. These are called essential amino acids, \\nof which there are nine (there are 20 in total).\\nBEnEfitS of A high-fiBrE diEt\\n✔ helps maintain bowel health \\nA high-fibre diet may lower your risk of developing haemor-\\nrhoids and small pouches in your colon (diverticular disease) \\nand also bowel cancer. Low-fibre intakes can lead to slow \\ntransit times (the time taken for food to pass through the gut) \\nand often result in constipation. \\n✔ lowers cholesterol levels\\nSoluble fibre found in beans, lentils, oats, fruit and vege tables \\nmay help lower total and LDL blood cholesterol levels. Studies \\nhave also shown that fibre may have other heart-health bene-\\nfits, such as reducing blood pressure and inflammation.\\n✔ helps control blood sugar levels\\nFibre, particularly soluble fibre, can slow the absorption of \\nglucose and help improve blood glucose control. A healthy \\ndiet that includes insoluble fibre may also reduce the risk of \\ndeveloping type 2 diabetes.\\n✔ helps weight control\\nFibre-rich foods are especially beneficial for weight control as \\nthey are more filling and take longer to digest in your  \\nstomach. A study of almost 3,000 adults in the USA showed \\nthat over ten years the people eating the most fibre gained \\nless weight than those with the lowest intake of fibre. Fibre \\nalso increases a food’s ‘chewing time’ so that your body has \\ntime to register that you are no longer hungry. This will make \\nyou less likely to over-eat and help you feel full for longer. \\n✔ reduces cancer risk\\nIn countries with traditionally high-fibre diets, diseases such \\nas bowel cancer, diabetes and coronary heart disease are \\nmuch less common than in the West. However, scientists are \\nunclear as to whether these benefits are due to fibre itself \\nor to other nutrients found naturally in fibre-rich foods. The \\nEuropean Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition \\n(EPIC) study of 519, 978 indi viduals, recruited from ten  \\nEuropean countries, found that in populations with low  \\naverage intake of dietary fibre, an approximate doubling  \\nof total fibre intake from foods could reduce the risk of  \\ncolorectal cancer by 40 per cent.\\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   16 19/12/2013   22:35'),\n",

It is also \\nneeded for making enzymes, hormones and antibodies. Along with this, the body \\ncan also use protein as a fuel. \\nHow much protein do I need?\\nThe Recommended Daily Amount (RDA) for the general population is 0.75 g/kg \\nof body weight a day. For example, for a 70 kg person the amount would be 53 g.\\n Regular exercisers need more protein than inactive people – around 50 to \\n100 per cent more than the dietary guidelines for the general public – to repair \\ndamaged muscle cells after intense exercise, as well as to build new muscle cells. \\nYou’ll need 1.3–1.8 g of protein/kg of body weight daily, depending on your sport \\nand how hard and how long you train (Phillips and Van Loon, 2011; Rodriques et \\nal., 2009; Phillips, 2007). If you do mostly endurance activities, such as running, \\naim to consume 1.2–1.4 g protein/kg of body weight a day. That’s 84–98 g daily \\nfor a 70 kg person. If you include regular strength and power activities such as \\nweight training in your programme, aim for 1.4–1.8\\xa0g/kg of body weight a day. \\nThis is 98–126 g daily for a 70 kg person. \\n Adolescent athletes will need extra protein to account for growth and \\ndevelopment as well as the exercise \\xadrelated requirement. Scientists estimate \\nthat they need around 1.2–1.4 g/kg of body weight (Boisseau et al., 2007). That’s \\n72–84\\xa0g for a 60 kg athlete. \\nWhat happens if you get too little or too much protein?\\nSkimping on protein occasionally isn’t a problem as the body can adapt to low \\nintakes in the short term by recycling amino acids (rather than excreting them). \\nBut, in the long term, eating too little protein can cause fatigue and slow recovery \\nafter workouts. It can also result in a loss of muscle tissue and strength. \\n Consuming more protein than you need is unlikely to be a problem pro vided \\nit isn’t excessive. Excess protein is broken down and partly excreted (in the form \\nof urea) and the rest of the molecule used as a fuel source. Contrary to popular \\nbelief, excess protein isn’t harmful. It doesn’t cause liver or kidney damage in \\nhealthy people, nor does it cause dehydration or bone mineral loss. On the other \\nhand, extra protein won’t give you any performance benefits either. Studies have \\ndemonstrated that eating more than you need for daily repair does not result in \\nadditional muscle growth, strength, stamina or speed.\\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   17 19/12/2013   22:35'),\n",

It is more satiating than \\ncarbohydrate or fat, so is particularly important for those wishing to lose or \\nmaintain weight without sacrificing muscle. When you consume protein, gut \\nhormones are released that signal to the appetite control centre in the brain \\nthat you are satiated, so you stop eating. Also, specific amino acids from the \\nbreakdown of protein (namely, leucine) acts on the hypothalamus region of the \\nbrain to reduce hunger (Davidenko et al., 2013). \\n Studies have shown that consuming a high \\xadprotein breakfast improves \\nappetite control and stops food cravings later in the day (Leidy et al., 2011). In \\none UK study, those who ate eggs for breakfast felt more satisfied and went on to \\neat fewer calories in the day than those who ate a high\\xadcarbohydrate breakfast of \\ncereal or croissants (Fallaize et al., 2012).\\n In practice, you should include around 20 g protein in each meal, equivalent \\nto about 85–100 g meat or fish or 600 ml milk (Rodrigues et al., 2009). Eating a \\ncarbohydrate\\xadrich meal lacking in protein (e.g. a jam sandwich) means you will \\nfeel hungry soon after eating. Avoid this by adding some protein (e.g. eggs, meat \\nor cheese) and reducing your carbohydrate portion (e.g. bread).\\nHow should I get my daily protein needs?\\nDifferent protein sources come with other nutrients (e.g. milk gives you calcium \\nand oily fish gives you omega\\xad3s) so it is a good idea to eat a mix of foods high \\nin protein. That way you will get a good balance of amino acids as well as a wider \\nrange of other nutrients such as fibre, vitamins, minerals and carbohydrate. Table \\n1.5 (overleaf ) gives the protein content of various foods, but you can also get an \\nidea of your protein intake by checking the labels of foods or using the free online \\ndatabase: http://www.food\\xaddatabase.co.uk/ for the amounts of protein in foods.\\n Animal sources such as poultry, fish, meat, dairy products and eggs generally \\nhave a higher biological value (BV) than plant sources such as tofu, Quorn TM, \\nbeans, lentils, nuts and cereals. That is, they contain higher levels of amino acids \\nin a form that is readily digested.\\nWhen should I have protein?\\nYou should balance your protein intake throughout the day, aiming to have about \\n20 g of protein in one sitting. Your body can only fully utilise a limited amount at \\na time, so try to distribute your protein intake evenly in between your meals and \\ninclude protein in snacks. Eating more than 20g of protein isn’t a problem (it will \\nstill get absorbed) but won’t necessarily increase muscle synthesis.\\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   18 19/12/2013   22:35'),\n",

It is made up of \\nfatty acids, which are essential components of every membrane of every cell \\nin your body. Without fatty acids, membranes would not function properly. \\nFat is also needed to absorb and transport the fat\\xadsoluble vitamins A, D, E and \\nK in the bloodstream, and is a source of the essential omega \\xad3 and omega \\xad6 \\npolyunsaturated fatty acids. \\n Fat itself may be high in calories, but that doesn’t mean it’s more likely to make \\nyou fat. In fact, quite the opposite is true. Fat is satiating, which means it gives the \\nbody the feeling of being full and therefore satisfies your appetite. By contrast, \\nreduced\\xadfat and low \\xadfat foods are more likely to be fattening as these foods are \\nnot satiating. Without fat (and fibre) in the mix, you are left hungry soon after \\neating, seek out more food, thus setting up a vicious cycle of over\\xadeating.\\nHow much fat?\\nThe IOC makes no specific recommendations for fat although the ACSM suggests \\nathletes follow the fat guidelines for the general population (20–35 per cent) \\n(this is too contentious given recent  media coverage and subsequent argument \\nbetween scientists and dieticians!)\\n Since the publication of the 3rd edition of this book, new evidence about \\nfat, obesity and health has emerged and previous advice to limit dietary fat is \\nless certain. UK national dietary guidelines were first issued in 1984 by the \\nDepartment of Health, based on studies (namely Ancel Keys’s Seven Countries \\nstudy) that suggested heart disease was caused by eating too much fat (Keys, \\nthE iMPortAncE of fAt\\n■  Essential for cell membrane \\nfunctionality\\n■  Plays a crucial role in the \\nabsorption and transportation \\nof essential vitamins\\n■  Eaten with fibre, it helps you \\nstay fuller for longer\\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   20 19/12/2013   22:35'),\n",

Despite this, advice to eat a low \\xadfat diet still forms \\nthe basis of UK and other countries’ dietary guidelines and  \\nfood policy.\\nDoes fat make you fat?\\nDespite a reduction in population fat intakes over the past 30 \\nyears, obesity has risen 10\\xadfold and in 2011 (the last available \\nfigures at the time of publication) was 26 per cent for women \\nand 24 per cent for men. The proportion of people either obese \\nor overweight was 58 per cent for women and 65 per cent for \\nmen. Similarly, type 2 diabetes rates have risen dramatically \\nfrom 800,000 in 1980 to 3 million in 2013.\\n So why have obesity and diabetes rates been rising? It’s \\ncertainly not due to people eating fat as intakes have actually \\nfallen. One of the problems is that people have been cutting \\nfat and replacing it with sugar and highly processed refined \\ncarbohydrate – a recipe for disaster. A high\\xadcarbohydrate, low\\xad\\nfat diet can increase blood triglyceride (fat) levels and makes a \\nheart attack more likely than eating a high\\xadfat diet (Astrup et al., \\n2010; Volek and Forsythe, 2005). \\nThe different types of fats\\nWhen we refer to saturated, monounsaturated or poly\\xad\\nunsaturated fats, we’re referring to the number of double \\nbonds in the fatty acid molecules:\\n■ Saturated fats contain no double bonds.\\n■ Monounsaturated fats contain one double bond.\\n■ Polyunsaturated fats contain two or more double bonds.\\nlow-cArB vS. high cArB diEtS for  \\nAthlEtES\\nA few well-known scientists have recently challenged \\nthe conventional high carb diet dogma and have sug-\\ngested that athletes can perform as well or better on a \\nlow carb diet.\\n The consensus of research suggests that carbo-\\nhydrate is required to fuel activities above 65 per cent \\nVO2 max – low glycogen levels result in early fatigue \\nand reduced endurance. One study by University of \\nConnecticut researchers concluded that a low carb diet \\ndid not compromise endurance performance, but this \\nstudy involved just five subjects (Phinney et al., 1983). \\nThe problem is that there have been no properly con-\\ntrolled trials comparing low carb and high carb diets on \\nathletic performance while keeping protein the same.\\n When it comes to weight loss, body compo sition and \\nheart health, low carbohydrate diets may have advan-\\ntages over low fat diets for some people. For example, \\nthose with insulin resistance. But the  evidence from \\nlarge meta-analyses suggests low carb diets are overall \\nno worse or better than low fat diets (Hu, et al., 2012, \\nJohnston et al., 2006). The reason low carb diets are \\neffective for weight loss is they provide more protein \\nand fat, which increases satiety, so you spontaneously \\neat fewer calories.\\n Generally, athletes are more insulin sensitive than \\nnon-athletes so will perform better on a higher carb \\ndiet. Elite endurance athletes from Kenya and Ethiopia \\nattribute their success to a high carb diet containing \\n9–10g/kg, well within the current ISSN and ACSM \\n(Onywerw et al., 2004; Beiss et al., 2011) recommen-\\ndations. At the moment, in the absence of randomised \\ncontrolled trials, it’s not possible to make a convincing \\ncase for low carb diets for all athletes. The truth is that \\nno one diet fits all.\\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   21 19/12/2013   22:35'),\n",

This popular theory first began in 1950s, when scientists \\nthought that this type of fat raised levels of LDL (low \\xaddensity lipo  proteins) \\n(‘bad’) cholesterol, which in turn caused atherosclerosis and heart disease. But \\nthis belief was based on studies that have since been challenged. Re\\xadexamining \\nthe data from Ancel Key’s Seven Countries study, scientists have come to very \\ndifferent conclusions. The original study omitted data from 16 countries but  \\nwhen these were included in the analysis, it turns out that countries with the \\nhighest percentage of calories from saturated fat had the \\nlowest rate of death due to heart disease: the opposite \\nof the study’s original findings (Siri\\xadTarino et al ., 2010). \\nFor example, people in France, Austria, Finland, Belgium, \\nIceland, the Netherlands and Switzerland have high levels \\nof saturated fat in their diets and low rates of heart disease \\n(European Cardiovascular Disease Statistics, 2008). Another \\nstudy that re\\xadanalysed the data from 21 previous prospective \\nepidemiological studies found no clear association between \\nsaturated fat and heart disease (Dreon, 1998). \\n In the Sydney Heart Study, those people who were told \\nto reduce saturated fats and increase their intake of poly\\xad\\nunsaturated vegetable oils were 70 per cent more likely to die \\nfrom heart disease than those who did not follow this advice \\n(Ramsden et al., 2013). The bottom line is: swapping saturated \\nfats for polyunsaturated fats does not decrease your cardio -\\nvascular risk. \\n In fact, certain types of saturated fats can raise levels of \\nHDL (high\\xaddensity lipoproteins) (‘good’) cholesterol, which is \\nthE rolE of SAturAtEd \\nfAtS\\n■  Structure and functioning of cell \\nmembranes  \\n■  Source of energy for the heart \\n■  Helps the bones take up calcium\\n■  Protects the liver from the \\neffects of alcohol\\n■  Surfactant in lungs (protects \\nfrom asthma) composed of satu-\\nrated fatty acids \\n■  Signalling messengers for \\nhormone manufacture\\n■  Proper functioning of the \\nimmune system\\nldl And hdl cholEStErol ExPlAinEd\\nAround 70 per cent of the cholesterol in your blood is \\ncarried on low density lipoproteins (LDL).

There are two \\ntypes of LDL:\\n■  Small dense LDL that sticks to arteries and causes \\nathero sclerosis (narrowing of the arteries)\\n■  Large LDL, which is harmless and does not cause \\natherosclerosis\\nSaturated fats only raise the large LDL, not the small \\nLDL, which means that they do not raise heart disease \\nrisk. It is the trans fats (see below) that increase the \\nharmful small LDL. The remaining cholesterol in your \\nblood is carried on high density lipoproteins (HDL). \\nThis ‘good’ HDL picks up and removes excess choles-\\nterol back to the liver for elimination from the body.\\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   22 19/12/2013   22:35'),\n",

High levels of \\nHDL are regarded as beneficial because it transports cholesterol from the \\narteries to the liver where it is either excreted or reused.\\ntrans fats\\nTrans fats are the harmful fats. Although tiny amounts occur naturally in \\nmeat and dairy products, most are formed artificially during the commercial \\nprocess of hydrogenation when vegetable oils are converted into hardened \\nhydrogenated fats. Hydrogen gas is pumped under very high pressure into \\npolyunsaturated vegetable oil, which straightens out the fatty acid molecules \\nand packs them closer together, making them hard like lard. \\n Nowadays trans fats are found in fewer foods but are still used in some \\ntakeaway and fast foods and by some manufacturers to make pastries and \\nbiscuits crispy, cakes moist and fillings creamy, and many processed foods \\nlast longer. However they increase blood levels of the small LDL cholesterol \\n(‘harmful’ cholesterol) while lowering HDL (‘good’) cholesterol, which \\nincreases your risk of heart disease. They may also encourage fat deposition \\naround your middle and increase the risk of diabetes (Ascherio and Willett, \\n1997; Mensink and Katan, 1990; Lopez\\xadGarcia et al., 2005). \\nHow much trans fat is safe?\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommend an intake less than 1 per \\ncent of energy, and the UK Department of Health recommends no more than \\n2 per cent – roughly 5 g/day. As trans fats are found naturally in meat and \\nmilk fat, a zero intake would be impractical. The food industry has voluntarily \\nreduced the use of hydrogenated fats and so current average intakes are \\nbelow the UK recom mendation. It is still worth checking food labels for \\nhydrogenated and partially hydrogenated fat as they may be found in some \\n(not all) fast foods and takeaways, pies, pastries and bakery items, margarines, \\ncereal bars and chocolate.\\nMonounsaturated fats\\nMonounsaturated fats lower harmful LDL cholesterol levels without affecting \\n‘good’ HDL and can cut your heart disease and cancer risk. Main sources \\ninclude:\\n■ Olive oil ■ Peanut butter\\n■ Rapeseed oil ■ Seeds\\n■ Avocados ■ Mayonnaise made with olive oil\\n■ Nuts\\nIn recent years, butter has received bad \\npress because it contains saturated fat \\nand cholesterol. Many people avoided \\nit on health grounds in the belief that \\nsaturated fats raised LDL cholesterol \\nand cause heart disease. However, \\nseveral major studies have failed to find \\nevidence that reducing saturated fat \\nreduces your risk of heart disease. The \\nsaturated fats in butter raise only the \\nbenign subtype of LDL cholesterol (see \\npage 22). \\n While the case against butter fades, \\nthe case against margarine and spreads \\ngrows. Researchers are addressing the \\ntheory that high intakes of omega-6 \\npolyunsaturated fats of the type found \\nin margarines and spreads may raise \\nyour heart disease risk. \\n An Australian study found that peo-\\nple with the highest intake of butter and \\ndairy fat had the lowest risk of heart dis-\\nease (Bonthuis et al., 2010). Similarly, \\na 20-year US study (the Framingham \\nHeart Study) concluded that margarine \\nincreased the risk of heart disease while \\nbutter had no effect (Gillman et al., \\n1997).\\n Two UK studies found that people \\nwith the highest intakes of dairy fat \\nhad the lowest risk for coronary heart \\ndisease, stroke and type 2 diabetes \\n(Elwood et al., 2008 and 2010).\\nButtEr vS.

Both are extremely important for maintaining the \\ncorrect structure of cell membranes in the body.\\nOmega-3 fats\\nOmega\\xad3 fatty acids include the short \\xadchain fatty acid alpha \\xadlinolenic acid (ALA) \\nfound in plant sources (such as walnuts and rapeseed oil), and the long \\xadchain \\nfatty acids eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA), both \\nfound only in fish oils.

Omega \\xad3 fatty acids protect \\nagainst heart disease and stroke and, according to recent research, may also help \\nimprove brain function, prevent Alzheimer’s disease, treat depression, and help \\nimprove the behaviour of children with dyslexia, dyspraxia and ADHD. For regular \\nexercisers, omega\\xad3s increase the delivery of oxygen to muscles, and improve \\naerobic capacity and endurance.

It may \\nalso play a role in muscle metabolism and performance too. \\nSunlight (UVB light) is the major source but when this isn’t \\navailable, then dietary sources become more important. The \\nproblem is that Vitamin D is found in relatively few foods: \\noily fish, eggs, butter and fortified cereals and margarine, so \\nit is not possible to meet your requirements from diet alone. \\nIt is believed that 60 per cent of adults in the UK are defi-\\ncient. Several studies suggest that vitamin D deficiency is \\nwidespread among athletes too, particularly those who train \\nmainly indoors or get little sun exposure, or do not consume \\nvitamin D-rich foods. According to recent studies a defi-\\nciency reduces muscle function and strength and may also \\nincrease the risk of stress fractures and illness – all of which \\nwill have a detrimental effect on your training and perfor-\\nmance (Hamilton, 2011). One study found that athletes with \\nhigher vitamin D levels could jump higher, quicker and with \\ngreater power than those with low levels (Larson-Meyer and \\nWillis, 2010). Another found that the vitamin increases the \\nsize of fast-twitch muscles and muscle strength (Halliday et \\nal., 2011). \\nHow much do you need? There’s no RDA in the UK, but \\nthe USA recommend intakes of 15µg/day (600IU) and the \\nEU recommend 5 µg/day.

They start to lose nutrients \\nfrom the moment they are chopped.\\n■ Fruit and vegetables should be eaten unpeeled wherever \\npossible – many vitamins and minerals are concentrated \\njust beneath the skin.\\n■ Use frozen food if fresh is not available as it is nutritionally \\nsimilar.\\n■ Cut fruit and vegetables into large pieces rather than \\nsmall, as vitamins are lost from cut surfaces.\\n■ Steam or boil vegetables in only the minimum amount \\nof water.\\n■ When boiling vegetables, add to fast-boiling water and \\ncook as briefly as possible until they are tender-crisp, not \\nsoft and mushy.

Salt\\nWhy do I need salt?\\nSalt is made of sodium and chloride molecules. There are approximately 2.4\\xa0g of \\nsodium in 6 g salt. This means that approximately 40 per cent of salt is sodium. \\nIn order to regulate the volume of blood circulating in the body and for the \\nmovement of fluid between cells, we need sodium. It also helps cells to absorb \\nnutrients from the blood and muscles to contract. The potassium/sodium balance \\nis absolutely critical to the overall functioning of every cell in the human body. If \\nsalt levels fall too low, a condition called hyponatraemia can develop, which can \\nbe fatal (see page 64).\\nHow much salt should I consume?\\nYou need a minimum amount of 575 mg sodium in your diet (equivalent to 1.4 g \\nsalt) to be healthy. Going under this level is associated with health problems and \\na greater risk of death. Eating too much salt can also be harmful – most studies \\nsuggest that excess sodium can increase blood pressure. \\n Currently, the Department of Health and most other medical organisations \\nrecommend limiting your daily salt intake to 6 g or 2.4 g sodium. They also advise \\nlimiting foods containing more than 1.25 g salt/100 g. \\n However, the evidence linking salt to heart disease and stroke is weak. A study \\npublished in the\\xa0 American Journal of Hypertension, which analysed data from \\nover 6,000 people, failed to find an association between lowered salt intake and \\nlowered risk for heart attacks, strokes, or death (Taylor et al., 2011).\\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   33 19/12/2013   22:35'),\n",

It found only a slight decrease in blood pressure \\n(3–6 mmHg systolic and 0–3mmHg diastolic) when there was a dramatic decrease \\nin salt excretion. Others have found that following a low\\xadsalt diet produces only \\nminimal reductions in blood pressure in most people. This may be due to the fact \\nthat individuals vary in how they respond to salt.\\nShould I be worried about salt and blood pressure?\\nFor most people, there is probably no need to be concerned about salt; your \\nkidneys regulate the amount of sodium in your body so if you consume more \\nthan you need, then it is excreted in the urine. It will cause just a temporary \\nincrease in blood pressure as extra water is drawn into the bloodstream to dilute \\nit. But this soon returns to normal as the sodium is excreted and blood volume \\nreturns to normal. \\n However, some people are more sensitive to sodium than others and \\ngenerally as you get older your sensitivity to sodium increases. This means excess \\nsodium may cause an above\\xadnormal rise in blood pressure. To reduce your risk of \\ndeveloping high blood pressure, you should not only cut salty foods from your \\ndiet, but also eat less processed food. \\n The bottom line is that if you eat  mostly unprocessed food you probably won’t \\nneed to worry too much about salt. As 75 per cent of the salt in most people’s diets \\ncomes from processed food (e.g. ham, bacon, sausages and burgers, bread, soups, \\nsauces, cheese, ready meals, pizzas, baked beans, breakfast cereals and biscuits), \\nit’s virtually impossible to eat a lot of salt if you base your diet on unprocessed \\nfoods. Eating less processed foods not only means you’ll be getting less salt, but \\nyou will also be getting less sugar, refined flour and calories. And it’s the latter \\nthree factors that cut your risk of obesity, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes \\nand heart disease. \\nDo I need extra salt on days when I exercise?\\nFor most types of exercise lasting less than three hours, there is no need to con\\xad\\nsume extra salt before, during or after exercise. It will not prevent cramps, heat \\nillness or sodium deficiency (Noakes, 2012).\\n10. water\\nWhy do I need it?\\nOf all the nutrients, water is the most important. It makes up more than 60 per \\ncent of your body weight and is vital to all cells. Water is the medium in which \\nto rEducE your Blood \\nPrESSurE\\n■ Consume extra fruit, vegetables \\nand dairy products for potas-\\nsium, magnesium and calcium.\\n■ Exercise (and lose weight if you \\nneed to).\\n■ Limit your intake of alcohol.\\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   34 19/12/2013   22:35'),\n",

Fluid acts as a \\ncushion for your nervous system and is a lubricant for your joints and eyes. Blood \\n– another key fluid – carries nutrients and oxygen to the cells and helps rid the \\nbody of toxins.\\n Physical and cognitive performance can suffer when we are poorly hydrated, \\nespecially in hot, humid conditions or when exercise is prolonged. Dehydration \\nduring exercise can lead to increased heart rate, increased per ception of effort, \\nand reduced performance. \\nHow much should I drink each day?\\nYou need to top up your fluid levels frequently because you lose water through \\nsweat, breathing and urine. The\\xa0 European Food Safety Authority recommends \\nan intake of 2.5 litres of water for men and 2.0 litres of water for women per day \\n(Jequier and Constant, 2010). This is supported by the Department of Health, which \\nrecommends that we should drink six to eight glasses of fluid per day. An easy \\nway to monitor changes in hydration status is to check the colour of your urine. It \\nshould be pale straw colour – anything darker and it shows more fluid is needed. \\n Maintaining normal hydration during exercise helps you work out longer and \\nperform better. The amount you should drink depends on your sweat rate, the \\nduration and intensity of exercise, and the surrounding temperature and humidity \\n(see Chapter 3). Dehydration may impair performance, speed and stamina. \\n As a rule, you should:\\n■ Begin your exercise session well hydrated. \\n■ Replenish fluid regularly, especially when sweat rates are high.\\n■ Be guided by thirst and don’t force yourself to drink (this may result in \\nhyponatraemia – low blood sodium levels).\\n■ Drink water during moderate\\xadintensity activities lasting less than 1 hour.\\n■ Drink water or isotonic drinks during high \\xadintensity activities lasting more \\nthan 1 hour.\\n■ Rehydrate after exercise – for most activities, water is the best option. \\n11. Alcohol\\nWhat is a safe level of alcohol?\\nThe UK Department of Health advises a maximum of 3 units per day and 14 \\nunits per week for women; and a maximum of 4 units per day and 21 units per \\nweek for men. One unit is equivalent to 10 ml or 8 g of alcohol, or half a pint of  \\nordinary\\xadstrength beer or lager, one small glass (125 ml) of 10 per cent wine, or a \\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   35 19/12/2013   22:36'),\n",

A standard 175 ml glass of 13 per cent wine contains \\n2 units. \\nIs alcohol beneficial or harmful?\\nAlcohol is a toxin, which means it harms your liver and every cell in your body. It \\ncannot be stored so is broken down by the liver, ultimately yielding ATP (energy). \\nThat means that any remaining calories that you have consumed are likely to be \\nconverted to fat. \\n Drinking more than the recommended level of alcohol makes you feel tired \\nand reduces your immunity, making you more susceptible to infections. In the \\nlong term it increases the risk of a long list of health conditions: breast, bowel, \\nstomach, throat and mouth cancers, heart disease, and stroke. For every 10\\xa0 g \\nof alcohol (approximately 1 unit) the risk of breast cancer increases by 7–12 per \\ncent. Too much alcohol also puts you at risk of high blood pressure, infertility and \\nalcohol\\xadrelated liver disease. Women are more vulner able to the harmful effects of \\nalcohol than men because they have less water and more fat in their bodies, and \\ntheir livers do not metabolise alcohol as quickly. \\n Alcohol in moderation is associated with a lowered heart disease risk, due in \\npart to its ability to increase levels of ‘good’ HDL cholesterol and reduce blood \\nplatelet stickiness. However, most of the research has been carried out on middle\\xad\\naged men and may not apply to women and younger men. Any heart protective \\neffect is probably small. \\n In saying this however, there might be other protective effects from red wine, \\nwhich contains polyphenols, saponins and a compound called resveratrol, all of \\nwhich can help lower ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol and protect from heart disease.\\nCan alcohol harm performance?\\nIf you’ve had a drink, it’s best to avoid exercising as alcohol will affect your \\nbalance, judgement, concentration and level of hydration. All the negative side \\neffects of alcohol fully outweigh any possible benefits it can have. It can reduce \\nyour strength, endurance, recovery, aerobic capacity, your ability to metabolise \\nfat and also impair muscle growth. \\n It causes inflammation in the muscle cells, which prevents muscle repair and, \\nin the long term, can actually damage the cells and result in a loss of functional \\nmuscle tissue.\\n Alcohol also slows muscle recovery and performance by disrupting your sleep. \\nResearchers have found that alcohol reduces sleep duration and increases wake\\xad\\nfulness (particularly in the second half of the night). This can reduce your human \\ngrowth hormone output – which builds muscle – by as much as 70 per cent. \\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   36 19/12/2013   22:36'),\n",

For most regular exercisers, a daily diet providing around \\n3–7 g/kg of carbohydrate (see page 7) will ensure full muscle glycogen stores.\\n The main purpose of your pre \\xadworkout meal is to stabilise your blood sugar \\nlevels during exercise.

You may become lightheaded, weak and shaky – \\nall symptoms of low blood sugar levels – and this will certainly stop you from \\nworking out.\\n Finally, you are more likely to fatigue early if muscle glycogen and blood sugar \\nlevels dip too low. According to Italian researchers, exercising in a fasted state \\nmay reduce your endurance and encourage your muscles to turn to protein for \\nfuel (Paoli et al., 2011).

This should \\nleave enough time to partially digest your food although, in practice, the \\nexact timing of your pre\\xadworkout meal may depend on your daily schedule. \\nYou should feel comfortable – neither full nor hungry. \\n According to a study at the University of North Carolina, eating a \\nmoderately high\\xadcarbohydrate, low\\xadfat meal 3 hours before exercise allows \\nyou to exercise longer and perform better (Maffucci and McMurray, 2000). \\nAthletes ate a meal either 3 hours or 6 hours before exercising on a treadmill \\nfor periods of 30 minutes without breaks; first at moderate intensity, then \\nswitching to high intensity, until they couldn’t run any further. The athletes ran \\nsignificantly longer after eating the meal 3 hours before training compared \\nwith when they had eaten 6 hours before.\\nWhat should I eat before exercise?\\nIn general, opt for a low\\xadGI meal – that is, foods that produce a gradual rise in \\nblood sugar levels (see page 11). Low\\xadGI foods help spare muscle glycogen \\nand avoid problems of low blood sugar levels during long training sessions \\n(Thomas et al., 1991).\\n Low\\xadGI meals may also help you \\nburn more fat and less glycogen \\nduring exercise. A 2003 study at \\nLoughborough University found \\nthat runners who ate a low\\xadGI meal \\n3 hours before exercise burned \\nmore fat than those who ate a high\\xad\\nGI meal with the same amount of \\ncarbohydrate (Wu et al., 2003).\\n A low \\xadGI meal before exer  cise \\nalso helps improve your endurance \\ncapacity. A study found that runners \\nwho ate a low\\xadGI meal were able to \\nrun 7 minutes longer than those who \\nate high\\xadGI foods (Wu and Williams, \\nQ&A\\nHow much carbohydrate should I con-\\nsume before exercise if my training will \\nbe longer than an hour?\\nIf your training will be longer than an \\nhour, plan a small carbohydrate-rich \\nsnack before the activity. The exact \\namount you should eat depends on \\nthe time interval between eating and \\ntraining and how hard and long you plan \\nto exercise. You’ll need to eat more for \\nlonger, harder workouts. In general, \\nyou should consume approximately 1 g \\ncarbohydrate/kg of body weight 1 hour \\nbefore exercise, 2 g/kg 2 hours before, \\nand so on.

This may be explained by the lower rise in blood glucose and insulin \\nfollowing the low\\xadGI meal, which means the muscles burn less glycogen and \\nglucose and more fat throughout the exercise session. \\n Ideally a low \\xadGI pre \\xadexercise meal should include protein and fat as well \\nas carbohydrate. Both protein and fat slow the digestion and absorption of \\ncarbohydrate and help to produce a slower and more sustained rise in blood \\nglucose. This should help give you longer\\xadlasting energy, and so greater endurance \\nduring your workout or event, and therefore produce better performance. \\nWithout protein and fat in the mix, you may get a rapid rise in blood glucose, but \\nthis will be followed by a rapid return to baseline levels (or even a dip) as insulin \\nlevels rise. This can leave you tired and lacking energy during your workout and \\nresult in early fatigue. Make sure you also include vegetables and/or fruit in \\nyour pre\\xadexercise meal as their high \\xadfibre content will also slow the delivery of \\ncarbohydrate to your bloodstream and avoid rapid rises in glucose and insulin. \\n It’s important to get the balance right. If you eat too much carbohydrate and \\ntoo little protein or fat (e.g. pasta with tomato sauce or a jam sandwich), then \\nyou may find yourself hungry and running low on energy halfway through your \\nworkout. You need some fat and protein in the mix to promote satiety. They \\nhelp prevent hunger and allow you to exercise longer without con suming extra \\ncarbohydrate. On the other hand, too much fat (e.g. fried burger or sausages and \\nchips) can delay stomach emptying, so you may begin your workout feeling full \\nand heavy. During your workout, digestion is further slowed as more blood is \\nrouted to your exercising muscles, so any carbohydrate in your pre\\xadexercise meal \\nare not available as fuel during your session. \\n The general rules are:\\n■ Eat a meal about 2–4 hours before exercise (if your schedule allows) to maxi\\xad\\nmise your endurance and performance. For example, if your training session \\nstarts at 5\\xa0p.m., have your low\\xadGI meal between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m.\\n■ For a low\\xadGI meal, include some protein and fat along with some carbo hydrate.\\nShould I eat anything in the hour before exercise?\\nFears that eating in the hour before exercise will produce hypoglycaemia are \\nunfounded as the majority of studies have shown this to be untrue (Jeukendrup \\nand Killer, 2010). Some studies have shown an improvement in performance \\n(Sherman et al., 1991) while others have found none (Febbraio et al., 2000). But, \\non balance, if you need a pre \\xadexercise energy boost, the safest strategy is to \\nconsume a small snack as close to the start of your session as possible. That way, \\nyou’ll get a smaller and more sustained rise in blood glucose (good), a smaller \\nQ&A\\nI prefer to train on an empty stomach \\n– should I force myself to eat if I’m \\nnot hungry?\\nMany runners claim they can’t \\nrun with food in their stomachs, \\ncom plaining of stitch, nausea or \\nstomach discomfort. It is down to \\nindividual preference, but if your \\ngoal is improved performance, then \\nit is possible to ‘train’ yourself to run \\nwith a small amount of food inside \\nyou. The  potential benefits are more \\nenergy and greater endurance.\\n Try different high-carbohydrate \\n options, such as a slice of toast, a \\nbanana, a small cereal or energy bar, \\na pot of yoghurt or a handful  \\nof dried fruit (such as raisins,  \\napricots or sultanas). If you can’t \\nface solid food, try a liquid meal: \\ndiluted fruit juice or squash, a \\nsmoothie,  flavoured milk or a sports \\ndrink. In any case, drink 150–250 ml \\nwater before  setting out. This will \\nhelp rehydrate you (especially \\nimportant if you train first thing in \\nthe morning) and reduce the risk of \\n dehydration during your workout. If \\nyou cannot eat anything before an \\nearly-morning workout, make sure \\nthat you eat well the day before, \\nwhich will ensure muscle glycogen \\nlevels are replenished.\\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   41 19/12/2013   22:36'),\n",

In other words, \\neating immediately before your session – provided you don’t over\\xaddo it – won’t \\nharm your performance. \\n So, if you can’t have a meal 2–4 hours before exercise, then eat a smaller meal \\nor snack 5–60 minutes beforehand. The timing and the amount will depend on \\nyour schedule, but it should comprise mostly carbohydrate along with some \\nprotein and fat – you should feel satisfied but not too full. Again, it doesn’t matter \\nwhether you choose high\\xad or low\\xadGI carbohydrate (Stannard, 2000).\\n On the other hand, if you have eaten a meal 2–4 hours before your session, \\nthen there’s little to be gained from having more food in the hour before exercise – \\nunless you are feeling hungry again. It is a good idea to experiment with different \\namounts and types of foods and vary the timing around exercise. For example, if \\nhunger strikes 2 hours after eating a meal, then add more fat or protein to your \\nmeal (these nutrients promote satiety) or have a further snack just before the \\nstart of your session. Exercising with a growling stomach isn’t conducive to good \\nperformance and may cause you to stop early.\\nShould I train low and compete high?\\nTraining with low glycogen stores may be worth trying as part of a periodised \\ntraining plan. It is used by some elite endurance athletes to improve their \\nperformance in competitions. The idea is to consume a low\\xadcarbohydrate diet \\nduring training, then a high \\xadcarbohydrate diet a few days before an event to fill \\nyour glycogen stores – a concept that’s been termed ‘train low, compete high’ . By \\ntraining with low levels of glycogen, your muscles adapt by burning fat instead \\nof glycogen. So they make more mitochondria (that burn fat) and more fat\\xad\\nburning enzymes, which (theoretically) prolongs your endurance (Hawley and \\nBurke, 2010; Burke et al., 2011). So when you switch to a high \\xadcarbohydrate diet \\nbefore your competition, you’ll not only have the ability to burn more fat but \\nyou’ll also have a full tank of glycogen to draw on. The downside is that exercising \\nwith low glycogen stores feels much harder so you may have to drop your pace. \\nThe research is in its early stages and while scientists have measured higher \\nconcentrations of fat\\xadburning enzymes in athletes, they haven’t yet proved that \\nthis translates into better performance during competition (Hawley et al., 2011; \\nMaughan and Shireffs, 2012).  \\nPre-exercise meals\\nThe following meals have a low or moderate GI and are best consumed 2–4 hours \\nbefore exercise:\\nQ&A\\nWill sugar before training give me a \\nquick energy fix?\\nSugary foods and drinks have a \\nhigh GI and can raise blood glucose \\nlevels rapidly. When these levels \\nare raised just before exercise there \\nis the potential for a rebound drop \\nin blood glucose levels (hypo-\\nglycaemia) during exercise. Typical \\nsymptoms include lightheadedness, \\nnausea, and early fatigue during \\nexercise. \\n If you haven’t eaten a meal \\nfor 4 hours or longer and you’re \\nplanning to exercise for an hour \\nor more, then sugar could help \\nmaintain blood  glucose levels – \\nbut so would other more nutritious \\noptions! Provided you have only \\na small amount (less than 25 g) \\n30 minutes before exercising, a \\nsugary snack or drink is unlikely \\nto harm your performance. But \\nmake sure it is only a small amount \\nas too much sugar may send your \\nblood glucose levels and insulin \\nsoaring. Rather than making you \\nfeel more energetic, sugar could \\nsap your energy. If you need a pre-\\ntraining energy boost, it’s safer to \\nchoose foods such as bananas or \\ndried fruit and nuts that are less \\nlikely to cause rapid increases in \\nblood sugar and insulin levels.\\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   42 19/12/2013   22:36\\nwww.ebook3000.com'),\n",

Studies have shown that consuming carbo hydrate, whether \\nin liquid or solid form, during exercise lasting over 60 minutes can help you keep \\ngoing longer (Burke et al, 2011). These additional carbohydrate will top up blood \\nglucose levels, fuel your muscles and spare muscle glycogen, particularly in the \\nlatter stages of your session when glycogen reserves are likely to be low. \\nIf you’re training 1–3 hours\\nTo give your muscles a decent carbohydrate boost during exercise, particularly \\nin the final glycogen\\xaddepleted stages, you need to take in at least 30 g of \\ncarbohydrate/hour during your session.

That’s equivalent to about 120–240 \\ncalories of carbohydrate/hour. \\nIf you’re training for longer than 3 hours\\nIf you’re exercising hard for longer than 3 hours, then consuming higher amounts \\n(60–90 g) of carbohydrate/hour in the form of a sports drink con taining glucose \\nand fructose (or maltodextrin and fructose) in a 2 to 1 ratio may help improve \\nyour performance, helping you keep going longer at a higher intensity (IOC, \\n2011). One study suggests that 68–78 g carbo hydrate/hour is the optimal \\ndose for events lasting 3 hours (Smith et al., 2013).

Happily take your time after training and worry about \\nyour post\\xadexercise meal when you feel hungry for it. As long as you eat well over \\nthe day, your muscles will be recovered for the next day’s training session.\\n But if you plan to work out or compete within 24 hours, then speedy recovery \\nis crucial. If you wait too long before eating or drinking, then you’ll feel sluggish \\nduring your next session; if you get it right, then you’ll recover faster. As a rule of \\nthumb, the sooner you can begin refuelling after exercise, the quicker your body \\nwill recover. \\n There is what scientists call a ‘recovery window’ , a period immediately after \\nexercise when the speed of glycogen replenishment and muscle manufacture \\nis greater than normal. Your muscle cells are more sensitive to insulin and the \\nenzymes that are responsible for making glycogen are most active immediately \\nafter your workout, leaving you a 2\\xadhour window to reload your muscle glycogen. \\nCarbohydrate is converted into glycogen one and a half times faster than normal \\nduring this post\\xadexercise period. \\n If you wait more than 2 hours, then your body’s ability to convert what you eat \\nor drink to glycogen drops by 66 per cent. The longer you wait, the longer it will \\ntake to start the recovery process. So have a carbohydrate\\xad and protein\\xadrich drink \\nor snack (see page 70) as soon as possible after your workout – ideally within 30 \\nminutes and no later than 2 hours. \\nWhat do I need for recovery?\\nFor optimal recovery, the major nutrients you need in order of priority are:\\n1. Carbohydrate – these are particularly impor  tant for aiding recovery for \\nendurance athletes. You’ll need 1–1.5 g for each 1 kg of your weight, so the \\nheavier you are, the more carbohydrate you’ll need to refill glycogen stores.\\n2. Protein – regardless of your weight, you need approxi  mately 20 g of protein \\nfor muscle repair.\\n3. Antioxidants – these will improve muscle recovery and reduce muscle inflam\\xad\\nmation/soreness.\\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   48 19/12/2013   22:36'),\n",

The harder and longer you trained, the more \\ncarbohydrate you need to replace. As a guide, high\\xadintensity endurance training \\n(e.g. fast running, cycling or swimming) will deplete glycogen more than low \\xad\\nintensity activities (e.g. walking, jogging or yoga) or intermittent activities that \\ninclude rest periods (e.g. weight training or recreational tennis). As a guide, \\nstudies recommend 1–1.5 g of carbohydrate/kg of body weight in the immediate \\npost\\xadexercise period (Rodrigues et al., 2009) but you should adjust this depending \\non your activity. For instance, a person weighing 70 \\xa0kg would need to consume  \\n70–105 g of carbohydrate. This is especially important if you have less than 8 \\nhours between sessions. \\nhigh- or low-gi carbohydrate after exercise?\\nIt doesn’t matter what type of carbohydrate you consume, although it’s \\nprobably beneficial to opt for a moderate\\xad or high\\xadGI source. The combination of \\ncarbohydrate with protein during the 2 \\xadhour post\\xadexercise period spikes insulin \\nto a greater degree than carbohydrate alone. This, in turn, leads to a rapid uptake \\nof glucose and amino acids from the bloodstream by the muscle cells. You can \\ninclude a little fat in this post\\xadexercise snack (e.g. peanut butter on toast) as it \\nwill not affect insulin release or muscle protein uptake. (See ‘Refuelling snacks’ on \\npages 53–55 for further suggestions.)\\n However, choose low \\xadGI meals thereafter. Researchers at Loughborough \\nUniversity have found that eating low \\xadGI meals during the 24 hours following \\nexercise improves endurance during your next workout. What’s more, it also \\nencourages the body to burn more fat and less carbohydrate, which helps shed \\nunwanted pounds as well as improve performance.\\nWhat should I eat after exercise?\\nFor speediest recovery, you should include both carbohydrate and protein in your \\npost\\xadexercise snack or meal. The combination of these two nutrients stimulates \\ngreater insulin release, which prompts the muscle cells to take up glucose and \\namino acids from the bloodstream. It also minimises protein breakdown and \\nencourages muscle rebuilding. Studies have found that a ratio of about 3 parts \\ncarbohydrate to 1 part protein boosts glycogen storage (Zawadski et al ., 1992; \\nPhillips et al ., 2007). It also promotes faster muscle repair and growth after a \\nweights workout or strength training (Van Loon, 2007; Bloomer et al ., 2000), \\nas well as after endurance exercise lasting longer than 1 hour.

Your post\\xadworkout meal or snack should, ideally, \\ncomprise about 20 g protein, although anywhere between 15–25 g would be \\nbeneficial. This will help promote faster muscle repair and greater muscle growth \\n(Moore et al., 2009; IOC, 2010; Rodrigues et al., 2009; Phillips and Van Loon, 2011).\\n However, muscle recovery doesn’t stop after 2 hours – it continues for several \\nhours, perhaps up to 24 hours. Your muscle cells are able to take up amino acids \\nmore readily during this time, which means muscle manufacture will be faster \\nthan normal. So you should continue consuming protein at regular intervals \\nthroughout the day. Aim to have around 15–25 g protein at each meal and also \\ninclude protein in your snacks. \\n In a one study, Canadian and Australian researchers found that protein evenly \\nspaced through the day was optimal for muscle building (Moore et al., 2012). \\nAthletes who consumed 4 meals containing 20 g of whey protein every 3 hours \\ngained more muscle protein than those who consumed either 8 x 10 g or 2 x 40 g \\nwhey protein over the same time period. \\n If you want to maximise muscle mass gain, it is also a good idea to consume \\nsome protein shortly before bedtime. One study found that athletes who \\nconsumed a protein drink before sleep had greater muscle protein uptake than \\nthose who had a placebo (Res et al., 2012).\\nWhat type of protein is best after exercise?\\nAll types of protein are useful for muscle repair, but if you’re looking to \\nmaximise muscle growth after exercise, opt for high\\xadquality proteins \\nthat contain all essential amino acids (Churchward \\xadVenne et al., 2012). \\nMilk, whey, casein (the latter two are derived from milk), egg and meat \\nhave produced best results in studies. \\n These foods are also rich in the amino acid leucine (see page 105), \\nwhich is an important ‘signalling amino acid’ . When it reaches the \\nmuscle cells, it triggers protein manufacture, which in turn leads to \\nincreased muscle strength. Whey is particularly high in leucine but you \\ncan also get it from milk. \\nQ&A\\nIf I don’t feel hungry after training, \\nshould I force myself to eat?\\nIronically, hard endurance training, \\nparticularly in warm conditions, \\ncan sometimes suppress your \\npost-workout appetite. This is \\nbecause more of the blood flow is \\nconcerned with exercising muscles, \\nso the hunger signals your brain \\nreceives from your gut sensors \\nbecome weakened. If the thought \\nof eating straight after a workout \\nmakes you feel queasy, try liquid \\nmeals such as milk, yoghurt drinks, \\nflavoured milk, milkshakes or \\nmeal replacement (carbo hydrate/\\nprotein) drinks. (See ‘Refuelling \\nsnacks’ on pages 53–55.)\\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   50 19/12/2013   22:36'),\n",

It is less expensive than commercial recovery \\nsports drinks and it’s been proven to aid muscle growth, promote muscle repair, \\nreduce muscle soreness and rehydrate the body – after both resistance and \\nendurance exercise, in men as well as women. Compared with traditional sports \\ndrinks, 500 ml milk consumed after training produces greater gains in muscle \\nmass and strength as well as a greater aerobic capacity, and reduced body fat \\nlevels (Cockburn et al., 2012; Ferguson\\xadStegall et al., 2011; Josse, 2010; Elliot, 2006; \\nHartman et al., 2007; Wilkinson, 2007; Karp et al., 2006). It also rehydrates you as \\nwell as, if not better than, isotonic sports drinks (Shirreffs et al., 2007). \\n In short, milk helps you recover faster and perform better in your next workout. \\nA 2008 study by researchers at Northumbria University found that athletes who \\ndrank 500 ml of semi\\xadskimmed milk or chocolate milk immedi ately after training \\nhad less muscle soreness and more rapid muscle recovery compared with \\ncommercial sports drinks or water (Cockburn et al., 2008). \\n What’s more, a 2009 study from James Madison University in the USA found \\nthat football players who drank chocolate \\xadflavoured milk after training had less \\nmuscle damage and faster muscle recovery compared with those who consumed \\na sports drink (Gilson et al., 2009).   \\n Just how milk works isn’t clear, but it is thought that the dairy peptides formed \\nduring digestion alter protein metabolism in the muscle and promote training \\nadaptations. \\nwill antioxidants improve my recovery?\\nMuscle soreness is due to several factors, but one of the factors responsible is the \\nbuild\\xadup of free radicals (molecules that have one or more unpaired electrons \\nin their orbit) generated during exercise. In the short term, free radicals can \\ndamage cell membranes and make the muscles sore. While reg u lar exercise \\nincreases the body’s natural defences against free radicals, you can boost them \\nfurther by con suming plenty of foods rich in anti  oxidant nutrients (see page 32). \\nHigh concentrations of antioxidants are found in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, \\nwhole grains, lentils and beans. These foods may help protect the body from free \\nQ&A\\nIs it true that the calories I eat after a \\nworkout won’t be stored as fat?\\nNot exactly: while carbohydrate \\ncalories after exercise will be con-\\nverted preferentially into glycogen, \\nthey can also be converted into \\nfat if you consume too much. The \\nenzymes that turn carbohydrate into \\nglycogen in your muscles can only \\ncomfortably handle 50–70 g carbo-\\nhydrate every 2 hours. Eat too much \\nin a short period and the resulting \\n‘overspill’ will be converted into fat.\\nTry to keep a check on portion sizes \\nand opt for snacks and meals with \\na low glycaemic load (GL; see page \\n13) such as yoghurt, a jacket potato \\nwith tuna, or a cheese sandwich. \\nAvoid meals or snacks with a high \\nGL and large portions of low-GI \\nfoods; for example, big bowls of \\npasta, jam sandwiches or even large \\nvolumes of energy drinks may give \\nyou more carbo hydrate than you \\nneed.\\n■ 3 eggs\\n■ 600 ml milk (or flavoured milk)\\n■ 27 g whey protein powder\\n■ 85 g Cheddar cheese\\n■ 85 g meat or poultry\\n■ 450 g plain yoghurt\\n■ 250 g strained Greek yoghurt\\n■ 100 g fish, e.g. salmon, plaice\\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   51 19/12/2013   22:36'),\n",

Another found that \\nit improves muscle strength recovery after weight training (Bowtell et al., 2011). \\nHow ever, there’s little evidence that taking extra antioxidants in the form of \\nsupplements has any benefit. \\nnutrition, exercise and immunity\\nMany athletes find that intense training can leave them susceptible to colds and \\ninfections. It is ironic that moderate training boosts your immune system but hard \\ntraining can lower your defences against germs and viruses – especially when \\ncombined with poor eating habits. The reason? Heavy prolonged training results \\nin increased levels of stress hormones (e.g. adrenaline and cortisol), which inhibits \\nyour immune system. For a few hours after an intense session, your immune cells \\nare depressed, making you more susceptible to infection during this period. Here \\nare some ways to reduce your chances of infection during hard\\xadtraining periods:\\n■ Ensure you eat enough calories to match your needs – more on the days you \\nexercise.\\n■ Avoid hard training in a carbohydrate\\xaddepleted state. Low glyco gen stores are \\nassociated with increases in cortisol levels and suppression of immune cells.\\n■ If you’re dieting and eating less carbohydrate, increase your protein intake. \\n■ Try taking supplements of echinacea for up to 4 weeks during a period of hard \\ntraining. Studies with athletes and non\\xadathletes have shown that echinacea \\nboosts the body’s own production of immune cells and results in greater \\nprotection against minor illnesses.\\n■ During long tough workouts, consume 30–60 g of carbohydrate/hour to stave \\noff the rise in stress hormones and the associated drop in immunity (Halsen et \\nal., 2004).\\n■ Ensure you are consuming plenty of foods rich in immunity\\xadboosting nutrients \\n– vitamins A, C, D, E, and B6, zinc, iron and magnesium. Best sources are fresh \\nfruit, vegetables, whole grains, beans, lentils, nuts and seeds.\\n■ Vitamin D plays a key role in immunity so make sure you’re getting plenty from \\ndietary sources (oily fish, eggs) or sunlight, other wise take a daily supplement \\nof around 10 µg of Vitamin D (see page 131).\\n■ A modest antioxidant \\xadrich supplement, such as cherry juice or elder  berry \\nextract,  may help to boost your defences and reduce the risk of upper \\xad\\nrespiratory infections.

Any type of milk will provide the protein needed to maximise \\nmuscle adaptation after strength and power training. It also contains the \\noptimal amount of the branched chain amino acid leucine to promote \\nmuscle building after exercise. \\n■ 500 ml yoghurt and fruit milkshake. Use 500 ml of milk plus yoghurt and \\nfresh fruit (in general, bananas, strawberries, pears, mango and pineapple \\ngive the best results) for an excellent mixture of protein, carbohydrate and \\nthose all\\xadimportant antioxidants.\\n■ 450 ml yoghurt. Choose plain yoghurt \\nafter a strength workout, or fruit yoghurt \\nafter an endurance session lasting an \\nhour or more. Both contain high\\xadquality \\nproteins that will accelerate muscle repair; \\nfruit yoghurt has added sugar containing \\nthe ideal 3 to 1 carbohydrate to protein \\nratio for speedy glycogen refuelling.\\n■ 330–500 ml whey protein shake. Shakes \\nmade up with milk or water are an easy \\nand con venient mini \\xadmeal in a glass. \\nQ&A\\nWhy do I find it hard to recover after a \\nworkout? \\nAre you overtraining? Rest is an essen-\\ntial part of a training programme – your \\nmuscles need time to refuel and repair. \\nTake at least one, if not two, days off \\nfrom exercise per week (see ‘The signs \\nof overtraining’ on page 54).\\nAre you eating enough carbo-\\nhydrate? If you’ve increased your  \\ntraining intensity or volume, you may \\nneed to step up your carbohydrate  \\nintake to 7–10 g/kg of body weight. \\nOne study found that runners con-\\nsuming 5 g/kg of body weight/day \\nduring an intense training period \\nexperi  enced greater fatigue and muscle \\nsoreness plus a drop in performance and \\nmood. These symptoms were reversed \\nwhen the runners increased their carbo-\\nhydrate intake to 8 g/kg/day (Achten et \\nal., 2004).\\nAre you anaemic? If your iron \\nstores are depleted, you’ll feel exces-\\nsively tired during exercise. Anaemia \\nis common, so ask your GP for a blood \\ntest that measures your serum ferritin \\n(stored iron). If your regular diet tends \\nto be a bit low in iron, consider a daily \\nmultivitamin containing at least 15 mg of \\niron. Also, try to include more iron-rich \\nfoods in your diet: red meat, fish, eggs, \\ngreen leafy veg e tables, nuts, beans and \\nlentils.\\n01bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   53 19/12/2013   22:36'),\n",

But it’s the \\nsweating that you need to pay attention to because as soon as you start \\nexercising you start to dehydrate. \\nSweating is a vital function. It rids your body of excess heat produced \\nduring exercise, maintaining your core body temperature within safe \\nlimits – around 37–38°C. Without sweating you would quickly over-heat \\nand die. Fluid loss can be high – up to 500 ml in 30 minutes – depending \\non how hard and long you are training as well as the surrounding \\ntemperature and humidity. Also, heavier people sweat more and some \\npeople simply sweat more than others. \\nIf you’re exercising for less than an hour, the risk of dehydration is \\nusually small and is unlikely to affect your performance. But if you’re \\nexercising for longer, especially in hot humid conditions, then loss of fluid \\nwill be greater and this may harm your performance. In these situations, \\nmaintaining hydration is crucial if you want to avoid heat-related illness \\nand perform at your best. At the same time, you need to ensure that \\nyou don’t overhydrate as this can also result in adverse symptoms. This \\nchapter explains how to develop your perfect hydration plan.\\nHow can dehydration affect my performance?\\nYour body can lose a certain amount of sweat without your performance being \\naffected, but at some point that loss of fluid starts to take a toll. This usually occurs \\nonce you have lost around 2–3 per cent in body weight – for example, after \\nabout an hour of intense exercise in hot humid conditions – and this can lead \\nto fatigue and a drop in performance during high-intensity endurance activities \\n(Goulet, 2012; Sawka et al., 2007; Shirreffs and Sawka, 2011; Cheuvront et al., 2003; \\nSawka, 1992). \\n In one study, running speeds over 5 km and 10 km dropped by 6–7 per cent \\nin runners who were dehydrated (2 per cent body weight loss) compared to full \\nhydration (Armstrong et al., 1985). This translated into a drop in performance of \\n2.62 minutes over 10 km. In another study, mild dehydration (2 per cent body \\n02bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   59 19/12/2013   22:46'),\n",

Researchers have found that dehydration up to 4 per cent does not \\nreduce performance in real-life situations, but dehydration greater than 2 per \\ncent will reduce performance in lab exercise studies (Goulet, 2013).\\n Once dehydration has reached a certain threshold, though, your body is \\nunable to cool itself efficiently, which puts extra stress on the heart and lungs \\nand means your heart must work harder to pump blood around the body. If you \\ndon’t consume enough fluid, your blood will become more viscous (or ‘thicker’) \\nand your heart will need to beat faster to pump the blood around your body \\n(Cheuvront et al., 2005). If dehydration continues, it can have more serious health \\nconsequences. A 5 per cent drop in body weight can result in headache, light -\\nheadedness, disorientation and shortness of breath. \\n Dehydration can affect strength and power training. One study found that \\ndehydration resulted in a loss of strength – the amount of weight male lifters \\ncould bench press was lower by about 6 kg when they were dehydrated \\ncompared to when they were rehydrated (Schoffstall et al., 2001). Dehydration \\nmay also increase levels of the catabolic hormone cortisol, and reduce levels of \\nthe anabolic hormone testosterone, thus potentially compromising the muscles’ \\nadaptation to training. \\nIs it possible to drink too much?\\nOverhydration can also have a negative impact on your health and on your \\nworkout. Too much fluid causes the sodium in the body to become too diluted, \\na condition called hyponatraemia, or low blood sodium concentration (see \\npage 64). Ironically, the symptoms are similar to those of dehydration: a drop in \\nathletic performance, nausea, lethargy, dizziness and disorientation. Con  tinued \\nhyponatraemia can lead to serious health consequences, such as blackouts  \\nand fits. \\nHow can I get the balance right?\\nThe key to avoiding dehydration and overhydration is to stay in your hydration \\nzone. This is the level of hydration that allows you to perform optimally. You can \\nget a good idea as to whether you are within your zone by weighing yourself \\nbefore and after exercise. You should never consume so much fluid that you \\nactually end up gaining weight. Equally, you should try to avoid losing more than \\n02bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   60 19/12/2013   22:46'),\n",

For example, if you weigh 68 kg (150 lb), 2 \\nper cent of your body weight is 1.4 kg (3 lb). So your hydration zone would be \\nbetween 66.6 kg and 68 kg. \\nWhat is the most important hydration advice? \\nAll researchers agree on one thing: you need to start a workout or competition \\nhydrated to minimise the risk of dehydration during exercise. This way you’ll have \\nthe best chance of putting in your best performance. If you begin dehydrated, \\nthis can adversely affect your performance, reducing your power output and your \\nendurance and causing early fatigue (Gigou et al., 2010). \\n The best strategy is to keep hydrated throughout the day rather than load up \\nwith fluid just before your workout. Try to make a habit of drinking water regularly. \\nHave a glass of water first thing in the morning and then schedule drinks during \\nyour day. If you train in the evening, ensure you drink plenty of water during the \\nday. If you train early in the morning, make sure to have a drink as soon as you \\nwake up. \\n The European Food Safety Authority recommends an intake of 2.5 litres of \\nwater for men and 2 litres of water for women per day (Jequier and Constant, \\n2010) – that’s approximately 8 glasses.\\n It’s better to drink little and often rather than drinking large amounts in one \\ngo, which promotes urination and a greater loss of fluid. Carry a bottle of water \\nwith you everywhere: to the gym, office and in the car, as a constant reminder  \\nto drink. \\nHow much should I drink before exercise?\\nThe American College of Sports Medicine recommends drinking 5–7 ml of fluid \\nper kg of body weight 4 hours before exercising (Sawka et al., 2007). This is \\napproximately 350–490 ml for a person weighing 70 kg, roughly equivalent to \\na small bottle of water. The idea is that you should have enough time for your \\nbody to excrete what it doesn’t need before you set off. It also ensures your body \\nmakes up for any previously incurred fluid deficit. Again, don’t drink it all in one \\ngo – divide into several smaller amounts and sip at regular  intervals. \\nHow can I tell if I’m dehydrated?\\nYou can monitor your hydration status by checking the colour of your urine \\n(the ‘pee test’). University of Connecticut researchers found that urine colour \\ncorrelates accurately with hydration status. A pale straw colour indicates good \\nhydration. If it’s darker and has a strong odour, then that’s a sign that you need to \\ndrink more fluid before you start exercising.\\n02bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   61 19/12/2013   22:46'),\n",

According \\nto several US studies, drinking caffeine-\\ncontaining drinks immedi ately before a \\nworkout won’t cause dehydration nor have \\nany detri mental effect on your perfor mance \\n(indeed, it may even enhance your endur-\\nance, see page 125).

Opt for a drink with sugar (e.g. squash \\nor diluted fruit juice) only if you haven’t eaten anything – in which case \\nthe sugars in the drink will help maintain blood sugar levels and fuel the \\nmuscles. Otherwise, water is a perfect pre-exercise choice, together with a \\npre-exercise meal or snack.\\nIs drinking to thirst optimum?\\nThe ACSM currently advise everyone to drink to thirst (Sawka et al., 2009). \\nFeeling thirsty is your body’s way of telling you that you need to drink \\nmore. Previously, experts advised drinking before you feel thirsty, but \\nthis was withdrawn in the light of the number of cases of overhydration \\n(hyponatraemia) during marathons and ultra-distance events. \\n A study of Boston marathon runners in 2005 found that 13 per cent \\nhad hyponatraemia (Almond et al., 2005). As a result, the governing \\nbody for marathon physicians (International Marathon Medical Directors \\nAssociation) made a recommendation that athletes should ‘drink to thirst’ \\nto avoid hyponatraemia during these events. \\n Some scientists, such as Professor Tim Noakes at the University of Cape \\nTown, believe that official advice on hydration has been influenced by \\nthe marketing claims of the sports drink industry, who have brainwashed \\nathletes to overhydrate. Noakes contends that quite large fluid losses \\ndon’t lead to dehydration or heat-related illness, and that elite endurance \\nathletes can tolerate significant sweat loss (over 3 per cent) without any \\nneg ative effect on their performance (Noakes, 2012). He believes that the \\nasso ciated weight loss via sweating may even enhance performance in \\nelite athletes as this improves their power to weight ratio. For example, if \\na 70 kg athlete loses 2 per cent of body weight (1.4 kg), then he or she \\nwill have 1.4 kg less to carry around, so less power will be needed at any  \\ngiven speed. \\n However, while the ACSM recommendation to drink to thirst may be \\nappropriate for some athletes (e.g. marathon runners who run relatively \\nslowly and take several hours to complete the course), it may not apply \\nto everyone. For example, if you’re a faster runner, competing in a shorter \\nevent, doing strength training, high-intensity endurance training, inter-\\nmittent activities or swimming, it’s harder to know when you’re thirsty and \\nhow much to drink. In practice, it can be easy to miss, ignore or override \\nthirst and this may prevent you from performing to your full potential. One \\n02bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   62 19/12/2013   22:46'),\n",

So a balance needs to be found \\nbetween preventing both hyponatraemia (overhydration), as well as \\ndehydration, heat stress and poor performance (underhydration).\\nHow much should I drink during exercise?\\nThere are no strict rules on how much you should drink during exercise. It \\ndepends on how heavily you are sweating, which in turn depends on your \\nsize, your exercise intensity and the temperature and humidity of your \\nsurroundings. Generally, bigger people sweat more because they have a \\nsmaller skin surface area to weight ratio so it takes more fluid to dissipate \\nthe heat. Also exercising at higher intensities and in hot humid conditions \\nincreases your sweat rate. It’s a myth that sweating heavily means you’re \\nunfit. The truth is, sweating is the body’s way of regulating temperature \\nso if you sweat readily and profusely it simply means you are getting rid \\nof heat. It does not necessarily indicate your level of fitness. \\n You may prefer to drink to thirst or follow a schedule that replaces fluid \\naccording to your sweat losses (as learned during training by weighing \\nyourself pre- and post-exercise). For most workouts and climates, 400–\\n800 ml/hour will prevent dehydration as well as overhydration. Aim to \\nconsume fluids at a rate that keeps pace with your sweat rate. You’ll sweat \\nmore in hot and humid conditions and when working out harder/faster. \\nIt’s better to drink little and often – say 100–150 ml every 15 minutes – \\nas this results in greater retention and less urination. You should start \\ndrinking early during your workout as it takes about 30 minutes for the \\nfluid to be absorbed into your bloodstream.\\nWorking out how much to drink\\nExperts advise drinking to thirst, but here’s a rough guide to calculating \\nyour fluid losses and working out how much to drink:\\n1. Know your baseline hydrated weight. \\nMake sure your urine is a light straw colour and then weigh yourself. \\nThis will give you your baseline fully hydrated weight. \\n2. Estimate your average sweat rate.\\nThis will vary according to your exercise intensity and surrounding \\ntemper ature, but the easiest way to work out how much fluid you \\nlose in sweat is to weigh yourself before and immediately after your \\nDeHyDrAtIon symptoms\\nThe initial signs and symptoms of mild  \\ndehydration appear when the body has lost \\nabout 2 per cent of its total fluid. These mild \\ndehydration symptoms include:\\nn Feeling thirsty\\nn Unusually lacking in energy\\nn Fatiguing early during exercise\\nn Feeling too hot\\nn Skin appears flushed and feels cool and \\nclammy\\nn Passing only small volumes of \\ndark-coloured urine\\nn Nausea\\nn Poor concentration and reduced alertness\\nAdvanced symptoms may include:\\nn A bad headache\\nn Becoming dizzy or lightheaded\\nn Appearing disorientated\\nn Shortness of breath\\n02bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   63 19/12/2013   22:46'),\n",

Your starting weight should be your baseline hydrated \\nweight. Remember not to drink anything for this test.\\n3. Work out your hydration requirement.\\nCalculate the difference between your pre- and post-workout weight \\xa0You \\ncan assume that almost all of your weight loss is sweat (although that’s \\nnot strictly accurate as a small amount will come from the breakdown of \\ncarbohydrate and fat). So a weight loss of 0.5 kg represents a fluid loss of \\nabout 500 ml. For each 1 kg lost, you should consume 1.5 litres of fluid after \\nexercise, so if you lose ½ kg, you need to make sure that you drink ¾ litre of \\nfluid per hour to fully restore fluid levels.\\nWhat should I drink during exercise?\\nIf you’re exercising for less than 30 minutes, then fluid losses through sweating \\nare unlikely to be great enough to harm your performance. If you’re exercising \\nfor longer than 30 minutes you will certainly benefit from drinking something \\nduring exercise. But with the growing array of sports drinks it’s a confusing \\nchoice for most people.\\nIf you’re exercising less than 1 hour\\nFor most activities, water is all you need. It is absorbed relatively quickly into \\nyour bloodstream and keeps your body hydrated. It’s cheap, plentiful and \\nreadily available. Extra carbohydrate won’t benefit your performance so it’s not \\nnecessary to consume anything else. \\n If you’re not keen on the taste of water, though, and cannot force enough \\ndown, flavour it with a little ‘sugar-free’ squash or cordial. This helps improve \\npalatability but won’t harm or improve your performance. If you prefer to \\ndrink ordi nary squash, cordial or diluted fruit juice, this will introduce extra \\nsugar (carbohydrate), but provided it’s diluted to less than 8 g sugar/100 ml it \\nwon’t harm your performance. Concentrated drinks containing more than 8 g \\nsugar/100 ml take longer to absorb so may reduce your performance. \\n Alternatively, just swilling a carbohydrate-containing drink (e.g. squash, \\ncordial or a sports drink) in your mouth could give you a per  for mance \\nboost. Carbohydrate sensors in your mouth send signals to the brain that \\nact on its reward and pleasure centres, so you feel more motivated to keep \\nexercising hard (see page 43). However, it’s still better to consume the drink if \\nyou can.\\nWHAt Is HyponAtrAemIA?\\nHyponatraemia is defined as having a \\nlow blood salt (sodium) concen tration \\n(<135mmol/L). This can happen \\nduring events lasting several hours \\n– such as cycling, marathon running \\nand hiking – when you drink water \\nexcessively. It can also occur when \\nyou lose a lot of sodium in sweat and \\ndrink water all the time. Excessive \\nsweating combined with drinking only \\nwater dilutes the concentration of salts \\nin the body to a dangerously low level. \\nBoth  scenarios can result in symptoms \\nof hypo natraemia: nausea, lethargy, \\ndizziness and mental confusion. If left \\nuntreated, it can lead to seizure, coma \\nand death. \\nThose most at risk of hypo-\\nnatraemia are the slowest runners  \\nwho take a long time to get round  \\nthe course, and therefore aren’t losing \\nthat much fluid through sweating. \\nRunning at a slow pace also makes it \\neasier to drink ‘on the run’ and drink \\nmore than you need. Best advice? If \\nyou plan to exercise for more than 4 \\nhours in warm weather, drink no more \\nthan 800 ml per hour, be guided by \\nthirst (don’t force yourself to drink) \\nand ensure that you don’t drink so \\nmuch that you weigh more after  \\nexercise than before. \\n02bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   64 19/12/2013   22:46'),\n",

The only value of sodium (and other electrolytes) \\nin sports drinks is to help your body retain water and stimulate thirst \\n– and this isn’t necessary during most activities that last for less than 2 \\nhours. What’s more, sodium in sports drinks will not prevent cramps or \\nheat illness (Noakes, 2012).\\n In general, sports drinks containing sodium are really only bene -\\nficial if you’re exercising at a high intensity for more than 2 hours (and \\ntherefore losing significant amounts of sodium in sweat), or in extremely \\nhot humid conditions when your sweat losses are exceptionally high. \\nHowever, one study at the University of Ottawa suggests that sodium \\nmay not be necessary if you’re exercising in fairly cool conditions \\nQ&A\\nWhich are better for rehydrating you: \\ncold or warm drinks?\\nCold drinks not only quench your \\nthirst better, but may also help  \\nimprove your perfor mance if you’re \\nexercising in hot and humid con-\\nditions.

So if you consume a lot of sodium then your sweat will contain \\nmore than those who consume less sodium. People in hot countries survive on a \\nfraction of the amount of salt eaten by people in the UK. \\n Unless you’re exercising for longer than 2 hours in hot humid conditions and \\nsweating profusely, then it is not necessary to consume a sports drink containing \\nelectrolytes. \\nsports drinks guide\\nWater is the best option if you’re exercising for less than an hour or if you’re \\nexercising at a fairly low intensity that doesn’t deplete your glycogen or make you \\nsweat much (e.g. in cool conditions). Most people may not consider plain water a \\nsports drink, but it is when it aids your performance. \\n But if you’re exercising at a high intensity for longer than an hour or you’re \\nsweating heavily, then a homemade or commercial sports drink may improve \\nyour performance and hasten your recovery. They are essentially sugar (and salt) \\nsolutions, and can be divided into four main categories:\\nn Low-calorie, hydration, ‘lite’ or fitness drinks\\nn Isotonic drinks\\nn Dual source sports drinks\\nn Recovery drinks\\nThe difference between the above is down to the concentration of sugars. As a \\nrule the higher the sugar content the slower the water absorption rate, but the \\ngreater the fuel delivery – you have to decide whether you need mainly fluid  \\nor fuel. \\n Sports drinks include commercial drinks as well as homemade drinks. As the \\nformer are expensive and, for most sports and fitness activities, unnecessary, \\nconsider making your own from everyday ingredients, such as squash or cordial, \\nfor a fraction of the cost. The formulation you choose is essentially down to your \\nperformance goals, budget and convenience. \\n02bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   66 19/12/2013   22:46'),\n",

This is clearly an advantage when you \\nare exercising at high intensities for prolonged periods (3 hours or longer) and \\ntherefore burning carbohydrate at a high rate. \\n Why do they contain two carbohydrate sources? Normally, the body can  not \\nabsorb more than 1.1 g glucose/minute – any excess sits in the stomach longer \\nand can result in discomfort – which is why scientists recom mend consuming \\nno more than 30–60 g carbohydrate/hour during prolonged endurance exercise. \\nHowever, when you mix fructose and glucose (or maltodextrin), carbohydrate \\nabsorption can be increased to 1.5 g/minute (or 90 g/hour), which increases \\nthe speed of carbohydrate delivery to the muscles (Wallis et al., 2005). However, \\na more recent study suggests that 78 g/hour may be the optimal dose (Smith \\net al., 2013). Faster absorption is due to the fact that fructose is absorbed by a \\ndifferent mechanism from glucose. Each sugar has its own ‘transporter’ that \\ntakes it from the intestines to the bloodstream. So, by consuming two different \\ntypes of carbohydrate (glucose/maltodextrin and fructose) you can utilise the \\ntwo different transporters instead of one and overcome the problem of glucose \\nsaturation. \\n Dual source sports drinks may feasibly help improve your performance \\nand endurance during exercise lasting more than 3 hours – for example, in \\nmarathons, triathlons, cycling events and ultra-distance events, where glycogen \\ndepletion would be a limiting factor. Do they work? Researchers at Birmingham \\nUniversity found that when cyclists consumed a 2 to 1 fructose drink during \\n3 hours of cycling, they completed a one-hour time trial 8 per cent faster \\ncompared with drinking either water or a glucose-only sports drink (Currell and  \\nJeukendrup, 2008).\\nWhen they may be useful:\\nThese drinks may be a good option if you’re exercising at a high intensity for \\nmore than 3 hours.

The carbo hydrate is usually \\na mixture of sugar and maltodextrin, and the protein may be whey or a mixture \\nof whey, casein and soy. They are designed to be consumed immediately after \\nexercise because consuming protein with carbohydrate stimulates muscle \\nprotein synthesis (i.e. muscle repair and growth) and therefore speeds \\nrecovery to a greater extent than carbohydrate alone. \\n The amounts and ratio of carbohydrate to protein varies between \\nbrands, but research has shown that a 3 to 1 ratio of carbohydrate to \\nprotein promotes most rapid glycogen refuelling (Phillips et al., 2007). \\nYou’ll need 1–1.5 g of carbohydrate/kg of body weight (Rodrigues et al., \\n2009), but you should adjust this depending on your activity. After long intense \\nendurance sessions when you’ve depleted significant amounts of glycogen, \\nyou’ll need more carbohydrate than after shorter sessions or strength training. \\nThe optimal amount of protein that promotes muscle building is 15–25 g (Moore \\net al., 2009). You’ll need more (i.e. a dose at the upper end of the range) after \\nstrength and power training, and less (i.e. a dose at the lower end of the range) \\nafter endurance activities. \\n Whey is a ‘fast-acting’ protein which is rapidly digested and absorbed. It also \\nhas all the essential amino acids and high levels of the branched chain amino \\nacid, leucine, which has been shown to trigger muscle protein synthesis. Studies \\nhave shown that whey is superior to casein and soy in promoting muscle repair \\nafter resistance exercise (Tang, 2009; Churchward-Venne et al., 2012). However, \\ncasein and soy are added to some brands because they are absorbed slower than \\nwhey and provide a ‘timed release’ of protein to the muscles. The whey delivers \\nquickly while the casein and soy provide a more sustained rise in blood levels of \\namino acids, extending the window for muscle building.\\nWhen they may be useful:\\nRecovery drinks may be useful if you’re planning to exercise again within 24 hours. \\nThe 2-hour period after exercise represents an ideal opportunity to maximise \\nmuscle recovery and glycogen refuelling because recovery takes place one and \\na half times faster than normal.

The problem is that even if you \\nwork out daily, it is hard to lose weight through exer-\\ncise alone. Increasing your activity will speed your fat \\nloss, but you also need to make some changes to the \\nway you eat. \\nMany popular diets are based on gimmicks or \\nunproven science and often involve cutting out certain \\nfood categories or limiting certain nutrients. Neither \\nstrategy will help you sustain weight loss. \\nThe secret to successful long-term fat loss is to \\nreduce total calories without compromising your intake \\nof essential nutrients. In practise, this means adjusting \\nyour carbohydrate intake and making dietary changes \\nthat are sustainable. \\nInstead, focus on the foods your body was designed \\nto eat, not processed foods, and adjust your carbo -\\nhydrate intake to suit your exercise programme. It’s a \\nmatter of listening to your body, responding to your \\nnatural appetite cues, and eating the amount of food \\nyou need. \\nThere isn’t one diet that is right for everyone. What \\nyou should eat depends on a lot of things including: age, \\ngender, current health, activity levels, goals, environ-\\nment, financial status and personal preferences, etc. \\nThis chapter provides you with a set of scientif ically \\nproven guidelines to help you lose fat, main tain muscle, \\nand achieve your optimal weight. \\nFirst, a quick lesson about body fat …\\nBody fat is not a redundant depot of unwanted calories. \\nAlthough it does serve as a fuel store, it has a number \\nof other important functions in the body. First, you \\nneed a certain amount of body fat (‘essential fat’) to \\nstay alive and for your body to function normally. Fat \\nis essential for the functioning of the brain, nerves \\nand bone marrow, and it cushions the internal organs \\nand keeps them warm. It is also impor tant for healthy \\nskin, hair and nails. Women need a certain amount of \\nbody fat to maintain normal hormonal balance and \\nmenstrual function. All this accounts for about 3 per \\ncent of body weight in men and 9–12 per cent of body \\nweight in women. If you go below these levels, then you \\nrisk health prob lems. Women can develop menstrual \\nirregularities and bone loss. \\nThe remainder is stored under the skin and around \\nthe abdominal organs. Here it serves \\na number of other critical roles in \\nyour body. Fat cells are \\ninvolved with hormone \\npro duction (they produce \\nthe appetite-regulating hor -\\nmone leptin, and also modify \\noestrogen) and they also \\nregulate the immune system. \\nPeople with very low body \\nfat levels are more prone to \\ninfection and illness. \\n02bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   75 19/12/2013   22:46'),\n",

These ranges are associated with the lowest health risk in \\npopulation studies. However, lower body fat levels are advan tageous to perfor -\\nmance in many sports: body fat levels in the region of 10–18 per cent in women \\nand 5–10 per cent in men are common among elite athletes. \\n But make sure your goal is realistic and that you don’t try to attain a body \\nfat level that is too low.

It’s not possible to prescribe a \\nbody fat that’s perfect for everyone – the optimum level of fat that produces peak \\nper formance is different for each sport and each individual. It’s best to think of an \\nopti mal body fat range that maximises your performance and minimises health \\nrisks. Use the above figures as a guide and then a combination of trial and error (as \\nwell as your good judgement) to find a weight and body fat that is right for you.  \\n For competitive athletes, there’s a weight and body fat at which you per  -\\nform at your best. However, you cannot maintain your competitive weight year- \\nround – it’s fine to gain a little weight (fat) between competitions. Try to keep \\nwithin 8 per cent of your competitive weight. For example, if you compete at a \\nweight of 65 kg, aim to stay within 5 kg of that weight – i.e. below 70 kg – between  \\ncom petitions.\\nto count calories or not?\\nCalories are the most important factor when it comes to weight loss. Ulti   mately \\nyou need to consume fewer calories than you expend to achieve your fat loss \\ngoal, but you do not necessarily need to count them. Simply focusing on the \\nsource, or quality, of your calories is often sufficient to create a calorie deficit. \\n Counting calories, checking labels and portion sizes can be time-consuming \\nand there’s usually a big margin of error involved. But on the plus side, it can make \\nyou more aware of your dietary habits and give you a better idea of what you’re \\neating. By being more conscious of what you eat, you will be able to eat more \\nhealthily. Of course, counting calories isn’t essential, but it is a tool that can help \\nget you started in the right direction. \\n If you don’t like the idea of calorie counting, focus instead on avoiding sugar \\nand processed foods and eating nutrient-dense unprocessed foods. \\nWHAt Are cALorIes?\\nIn simple terms, a calorie is a unit \\nof energy. Specifically, it’s the \\namount of energy required to \\nheat 1 g of water by 1°C. As this \\nis a very small amount of energy, \\nfood labels use larger units called \\nkilocalories (kcal), which is 1,000 \\ncalories. When people mention \\ncalories in the everyday sense, \\nthey are really talking about \\nkilocalories.\\n02bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   76 19/12/2013   22:46'),\n",

A goal has to be personal, specific, realistic and measurable:\\nn Personal – you have to believe in your goal and truly want to achieve it. For \\nexample, ‘I know that losing 5 lb will allow me to run faster and make the top \\n10 in my next half-marathon. ’\\nn Specific – you need to clearly define what you want to achieve. For example, ‘I \\nwant to reduce my waist size by 6 cm in six weeks. ’\\nn Realistic – your goal has to be realistic and attainable for your body shape and \\nlifestyle. \\nn Measurable – you need to track your progress and state how you will know \\nwhen you’ve reached your goal. Keeping a food diary and training log will help \\nyou monitor your progress and allow you to see whether you met the goal.\\nYour goal should also be:\\nn Agreed – agree your goal with someone else (e.g. your coach or a friend) and \\nwrite it down. This signals a commitment to change and makes it more likely \\nthat you will be successful.\\nn Time\\xadscaled – once you have decided on your goal, you should prioritise steps, \\norganise plans, and establish a timescale for reaching your goal.\\nn Reward yourself – rewarding yourself when you have reached a goal helps you \\nstay motivated and focused. Rewards can be something simple like going to \\nwatch a film for reaching a weekly target or a new pair of training shoes for \\nreaching a six-month goal.\\nFour weight loss myths debunked\\nThere are many myths when it comes to fat loss that could be preventing you \\nfrom reaching your health and performance goals. Here’s the truth about four of \\nthe most common weight loss myths:\\nMyth 1: Exercising on an empty stomach makes you lose  \\nweight faster\\nExercising on an empty stomach – such as first thing in the morning – may force \\nyour body to burn more fat than carbohydrate for fuel, but it won’t necessarily \\nhelp you lose weight faster. Researchers at Northumbria University asked 12 male \\nvolunteers to do a moderate-intensity treadmill workout at 10 a.m. either after \\n02bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   77 19/12/2013   22:46'),\n",

They found that \\nthose who exercised on an empty stomach burned up to 20 per cent more fat \\ncompared with those who ate a meal before training. \\n A study by Belgian researchers found that the muscles could be ‘trained’ to \\nburn a higher percentage of fat by exercising in a fasted state (Proeyen et al., 2011). \\nAthletes completed a workout, either after they had fasted or after consuming \\ncarbohydrate. After six weeks, those who trained after fasting burned a higher \\npercentage of calories from fat and increased the number of fat-burning enzymes \\nin their muscles. \\n However, all this doesn’t mean you’ll lose more fat. A study at Lough borough \\nUniversity found that those who exercised before breakfast ate the same number \\nof calories over the course of the day as those who exercised after breakfast \\n(Deighton et al., 2012). \\n The bottom line is that if you’re exercising to lose fat, then exercising on an \\nempty stomach may in theory burn more fat, but it won’t necessarily help you \\nshed the pounds faster. What matters is your overall daily calorie intake relative to \\nyour output.\\nMyth 2: All calories are equal\\nIn principle, all calories are equal in terms of the energy they deliver. How  ever, \\nthe amount of energy you get from a food depends on where those calories \\ncome from (i.e. protein, carbohydrate or fat). In other words, 100 calories worth of \\nchicken or broccoli is not the same as 100 calories worth of sugar. \\n Different foods have different effects on your body, even if they contain \\nthe same number of calories. Once ingested, proteins, carbohydrate and fats \\nare digested, absorbed and metabolised by the body. The energy required for \\nthese processes differs between the various macronutrients. Some of the calories \\nyou consume are used up digesting the food and turning it into fuel available \\nto the body. This is called the thermic effect of food, or thermogenesis. For \\nexample, the body uses more calories to digest and metabolise protein than it \\ndoes carbohydrate or fat. When you consume protein, approximately 25–30 per \\ncent is ‘wasted’ or lost as heat. In contrast, 6–8 per cent of the calories consumed \\nin the form of carbohydrate and 2–3 per cent of the calories in fat are used up \\nin digesting it (Jequier et al., 2002). In other words, carbohydrate and fat are \\nrelatively easy for the body to turn into energy. Protein needs to be broken down \\ninto amino acids, which is a far more complex process. So if you eat 100 calories of \\nprotein, only about 70–75 will be absorbed – the rest is lost as heat.\\n You also need to consider the effects the different macronutrients have on \\nsatiety (how full up they make you feel). Protein has the highest satiating effect, \\n02bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   78 19/12/2013   22:46'),\n",

So 100 calories of \\nsteak will make you feel more satiated than 100 calories of crisps.\\n Some types of calories can alter levels of hormones in your brain and cause \\nyou to eat more. For example, sugar promotes overconsumption because it acts \\non the areas in the brain involved with reward and cravings (see page 8). Protein, \\nfat and low-GI (non-sweetened) carbohydrate, on the other hand, are less likely to \\nmake you want to eat more after consuming them.\\n In summary, when looking purely from a measurement perspective, all \\ncalories are equal, but in terms of weight management and health, they are not. \\nThat’s why you need to focus on the quality of the calories you’re eating and not \\nsimply count calories. \\nMyth 3: You need to cut or burn 3,500 calories to lose a pound\\nThe 3,500-calories-equals-a-pound rule is regarded as dogma when it comes \\nto dieting but is not very accurate. This bit of arithmetic comes from a small \\nstarvation study done in the 1950s. It has no scientific basis and doesn’t take \\naccount of your body composition, your current weight or metabolism. \\n Cutting 3,500 calories to lose a pound may ‘work’ for the first 10 to 12 days of \\na diet as you lose water weight, but when the body weight drops you carry less \\nmass and start to burn fewer calories for the same activities. After a period of time, \\nyou stop losing weight even if you continue to cut back by the same amount. This \\nis called ‘adaptive thermogenesis’ and refers to the lowering of your metabolic \\nrate as your body weight goes down and you eat fewer calories (Rosenbaum and \\nLeibel, 2010). Essentially it’s your body’s way of conserving energy when energy \\nis in short supply (Tremblay et al., 2013). One study found that when people were \\nput on a restricted-calorie diet, they had a lower metabolic rate than could be \\nexplained by their weight loss (Heilbronn et al., 2006). \\n What’s more, when you create a calorie deficit by eating less, you don’t just \\nlose fat but you burn off protein too. So any weight loss comes from a loss of both \\nfat and muscle mass.\\nMyth 4: Fat makes you fat\\nThis myth is based on the premise that at 9 calories/g, fat is more fattening than \\nother nutrients. The truth is that fat is no more likely to make you fat than any \\nother nutrient – possibly less so. Fat plays an important structural role in the body, \\nhelping to form cell membranes and make hormones. \\n Fat may be high in calories, but it is also satiating so it gives the body the \\nfeeling of being full – providing you eat fat in as natural a form as possible (e.g. \\nmilk, cheese, nuts, fish) and not in a highly processed form (e.g. biscuits, cakes and \\n02bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   79 19/12/2013   22:46'),\n",

Contrary to popular belief, fats can actually help you lose weight \\nbecause they help appetite control. Refined carbohydrate and sugar,  \\non the other hand, don’t promote satiety and can make you want to \\neat more.\\n Rather than avoiding fat to lose fat, add natural unprocessed fats, \\nsuch as butter, olive oil, nuts, seeds, oily fish and avocados, to your \\ndiet, while cutting down on sugar and refined carbohydrate.\\nten steps to fat loss\\nEveryone loses (and gains) weight differently and there’s no one \\ndiet that will work the same for everyone. In fact there is no ‘right’ \\ndiet, nor is there any evidence that one particular diet works better \\nwith an individual’s specific metabolism (Pagoto and Appelhans, 2013). \\nThe truth is that ALL diets will work if you follow them. Some people \\nare predisposed to gain weight easily and must work harder than the \\naverage person to burn it off. But one thing is certain:  that losing fat \\nrequires a sustained daily effort. Here we look at ten ways that will help \\nyou lose fat without sacrificing hard-earned muscle. \\n1. Eat real food\\nLosing fat is far easier if you focus on ‘real’ foods, for example, minimally \\nprocessed foods such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans, lentils, nuts, \\nseeds, fruit, vegetables, whole grains, tubers, milk, cheese, yoghurt, \\nbutter, olive oil and butter. \\n Real food is filling, satiating and delicious. When you focus on eating \\nthese foods you will feel less hungry, and have less desire to eat ‘junk’ \\nfood. Eating real food limits the amount you eat without needing \\nmuch restraint. It helps reduce the total number of calories you eat. \\nFor example, it takes fewer calories to fill up with vegetables than \\nwith crisps. Try eating vegetables or salad first at every meal before \\neverything else. You’ll find that you’ll eat fewer calories as these foods \\nhave a high satiety rating. Put simply, you’ll burn more calories, feel \\nmore satiated, and lose more weight if you get most of your calories \\nfrom ‘real’ food rather than from processed food even if the calories are \\nthe same. \\n Avoid high-sugar foods and drinks, and any processed foods labelled \\n‘low fat’ , ‘reduced fat’ or ‘fat-free’ . These fat-reduced foods are often higher \\nin sugar, starch or salt than the full-fat versions to make up for the flavour \\nand texture that’s lost when food manufacturers take out the fat. \\n02bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   80 19/12/2013   22:46'),\n",

They fail \\nto satisfy your appetite and reduce levels of dopamine (a feel-good hormone) \\nin the brain and can cause overeating. Because these foods claim to be ‘low in \\nfat’ , we automatically assume they are healthy and tend to eat bigger portions \\n(i.e. more calories) as shown in a study by Cornell University in the USA where \\npeople who were given products labelled ‘light’ or ‘reduced fat’ ate up to 50 per \\ncent more than they did with the standard product.\\n2. Adjust carbohydrate\\nThe key to fat loss is to adjust your carbohydrate intake. This doesn’t mean \\ncutting carbohydrate completely or forgoing pasta and potatoes, but reducing \\ncarbohydrate to a level that gives you just enough fuel for your training, but not \\ntoo little to cause fatigue or illness. Training at high intensities with low glycogen \\nlevels may result in fatigue, lethargy and poor performance. Over time, eating too \\nlittle carbohydrate may lead to overtraining, where your performance drops and \\nyour health suffers. \\n If you do high-intensity endurance training, then you’ll certainly need carbo -\\nhydrate immediately before and after training as you can’t fuel intense exercise \\n(more than 70 per cent of maximal aerobic capacity) from fat alone. On the other \\nhand, if you do mostly lower-intensity training (less than 70 per cent of maximal \\naerobic capacity), then cutting carbohydrate and training with lower muscle \\nglycogen levels should not adversely affect your performance. \\n Reducing carbohydrate not only lowers your calorie intake, but it also lowers \\nyour insulin levels, which puts your body in fat-burning mode rather than fat-\\nstorage mode. The job of insulin is to transport glucose and fatty acids from the \\nblood into cells. When insulin levels are high (e.g. after eating a high-carbohydrate \\nmeal), the body stops burning fat and burns carbohydrate instead. It also makes \\nthe body store excess carbohydrate (as glyco gen or fat) and fat. By reducing your \\ncarbo hydrate intake, you will lower blood glucose levels and insulin pro  duction, \\nwhich means less fat storage and more fat burning. In other words, the body will \\nturn to fat (not carbohydrate) for fuel. \\n By cutting carbohydrate from high-sugar foods and drinks you’ll also find it \\nmuch easier to control your appetite. High intakes of sugar (fructose) can alter the \\nbalance of brain chemicals as it acts on the same hormonal pathways that reward \\nbehaviour. Rather than satisfying your appetite it may increase it (see page 8).\\n So, how much carbohydrate should you eat? There are no hard and fast \\nrules – it’s essentially a matter of minimising sugars and processed starches, and \\n02bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   81 19/12/2013   22:46'),\n",

These foods reduce \\nappetite, promote satiety, and cause an automatic restriction in calories (making \\ncalorie counting unnecessary in many cases). Protein also spares muscle, so you \\nshould be able to maintain your hard-earned muscle while losing fat. \\n You’ll need to eat less than your ‘maintenance’ level and you’ll need to eat \\nmore on training days when your energy needs are higher. For most people, this \\nis likely to average 3–5 g carbohydrate/kg of body weight/day (Phillips and van \\nLoon, 2011). \\n Table 4.1 gives you a suggested amount of carbohydrate based on your \\nactivity level. For example, if you’re in the ‘moderate-intensity training’ category \\n(exercising for an hour a day), you should eat 3–5 g carbohydrate/kg of body \\nweight/day. Try to get most of your carbohydrate in the 2–4-hour time period \\nbefore exercise and the 2–4-hour time period after exercise so that your \\nperformance won’t suffer and you will have enough energy to train hard. \\n High-carbohydrate foods should be the mainstay of your meals before and \\nafter intense training sessions. Aim for around 50–200 g of carbohydrate 2–4 \\nhours before exercise, depending on how close your meal is to your workout, and \\nalso how long and hard you plan to train. If you have very little time between \\neating and exercising, or if you plan to exercise for less than an hour, then eat less. \\nOn the other hand, if you have longer to digest your food or if you plan to do a \\nhard session lasting more than an hour, then eat more carbohydrate. \\n Consuming adequate carbohydrate is particularly important in the period \\nimmediately following intense exercise as this can speed recovery and help \\nprevent overtraining. Your muscles are more sensitive to insulin in the 2-hour \\nperiod following exercise, and glycogen manufacture is one and a half times \\nfaster than normal. Aim for about 1 g/kg of body weight, or 60 g for a 60 kg \\nperson, but adjust this according to the duration and intensity of your workout. \\nIf you have exercised longer than 2 hours, you may need more as your glycogen \\nstores will be depleted. If you have exercised for less than an hour (or at a low \\nintensity), then you will need less. Adding 15–25 g protein to your post-exercise \\nrecovery drinks and meals will promote optimal recovery after hard training  \\n(see page 50). \\n By eating less carbohydrate and storing less glycogen, you can literally \\n‘train’ your muscles to use more fat and less carbohydrate for fuel. If there is \\nless blood glucose or muscle glycogen available, the muscles will turn to fat \\nfor fuel. So limiting carbohydrate and eating fat causes the muscles to adapt to \\nfat for endurance activities. However, this only applies to endurance activities \\nperformed at a low to moderate intensity, such as walking, cycling and running, \\nand not high-intensity endurance (e.g. running fast) or anaerobic activities (e.g. \\nQ&A\\nAre low-carbohydrate diets healthy?\\nAn analysis of 23 randomised \\ncon trolled trials concluded that \\nlow-carbohydrate diets are effec-\\ntive for producing weight loss as \\nwell as lowering important risk \\nfactors for heart disease, including \\nabdominal fat, blood pressure and \\nblood fats (Santos et al., 2012). \\nAnother study found that people \\nfollowing a low-carbohydrate \\nhigh-fat diet lost more body fat \\nthan those following a high-carbo-\\nhydrate low-fat diet, and reduced \\ntheir risk of metabolic syndrome \\n(Volek et al., 2009). \\n02bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   82 19/12/2013   22:46'),\n",

Low-fat diets are not satiating. The bottom line? To lose weight and stay \\nlean, stick with full-fat versions of real foods and listen to your appetite. That way, \\nyou’ll eat fewer calories overall. \\n Feeling full and satisfied while eating nutritious foods you like makes it much \\neasier to lose unwanted pounds. Without fat in the mix, you are left hungry soon \\nafter eating, seek out another low-fat ‘fix’ , thus setting up a vicious cycle of over-\\neating.\\n The biggest mistake is reducing fat while cutting carbohydrate – you’ll end up \\nstarving! Eating foods that satisfy your hunger will mean that you consume fewer \\ncalories – it’s that simple.\\n Higher-fat diets may be more successful in promoting weight loss than low-\\nfat diets. In one study, people who ate a higher-fat Mediterranean-style diet (35 \\nper cent of calories from fat) lost more weight than those following a low-fat diet \\nfor two years (Shai et al., 2008).\\n4. Up your protein intake\\nMake sure you include adequate amounts of protein. Not eating enough protein \\nmay induce hunger and muscle loss when you’re dieting.\\n Protein has also been shown to reduce appetite and induce satiety (‘fullness’) \\nmore than carbohydrate, which is why it is par  ticu larly useful when you’re trying \\nto lose (or maintain) weight (Westerterp-Plantenga et al., 2012). Protein slows the \\ntime it takes for food to move from your stomach to your intestines, helping you \\nfeel full longer. It also reduces levels of hunger hormones, such as ghrelin, and \\nincreases levels of satiety hormones such as glucagon and cholecystokinin, which \\ntell the brain that you’re full. One study found that the more protein and less \\ncarbohydrate people ate, the less hungry they felt (Belza et al., 2013). Those who \\nate the most protein had the highest levels of satiety hormones and the lowest \\nlevels of hunger hormones. \\n Carbohydrate simply doesn’t provide the same satiated feeling that protein \\ndoes. Therefore if you increase your protein intake without making any conscious \\nattempt to eat less, you’ll naturally eat less anyway due to reduced appetite. This \\nis another important sense in which protein, carbohydrate and fat calories are not \\nequal (see page 78).  \\n One study found that protein not only helped people feel less hungry, but it \\nalso resulted in significant weight loss (Weigle et al., 2005). When dieters increased \\ntheir protein intake from 15 per cent to 30 per cent of total calories, they felt much \\nfuller even though they ate the same number of calories.

A study found that when \\nathletes ate 1.6 g protein/kg of body weight (twice the RDA) or 2.4 \\ng/protein/kg of body weight (three times the RDA), they lost more \\nfat and less muscle compared with those who just ate the RDA for \\nprotein – 0.8 g/kg of body weight (Pasiakos et al., 2013). All three \\ngroups lost the same amount of weight, but those eating extra \\nprotein had a more favourable body composition at the end of the \\ndieting period. Increasing protein from two to three times the RDA \\nmade no difference, so the optimal amount of protein is likely to \\nbe between 1.6 g and 2.4/kg/body weight (Phillips and Van Loon, \\n2011). That’s 112–168 g for a 70 kg person. \\n Include a portion of high-quality protein (meat, poultry, fish, \\ndairy foods, eggs) with each meal. The exact amount will depend on \\nyour fitness programme or sport, but aim for 1.6–2.0 g of protein/\\nkg of body weight. For speedy recovery, you should also include \\naround 15–25 g protein in your post-exercise snack (see page 50).\\n5. Eat when hungry\\nIt may sound obvious, but if you eat only when you’re hungry \\nand listen to your body’s appetite cues then your weight will \\nautomatically find its set-point (provided you also follow the rest of \\nthe advice in this chapter). If you’re not hungry you probably don’t \\nneed to eat yet. There’s no need to eat if your body doesn’t need \\nthe fuel.\\n6. Choose naturally fibre-rich foods\\nIf you eat mostly unprocessed food you’ll automatically reap the \\nbenefits of fibre. Foods such as fruit, vegetables, beans, fish and \\nwhole grains do a better job of satisfying your hunger than foods \\nrich in sugar and refined starch. Low-satiety foods, such as cakes, bis-\\ncuits and chocolate, are easy to over-eat, empty from your stomach \\nquickly, and leave you hungry again in a relatively short time. \\n By taking up more space in your stomach, fibre-rich foods help \\nto fill you up and reduce your appetite. Fibre expands in the gut, \\nHoW to cut DoWn on suGAr\\n1. Avoid:\\nn Soft drinks – these contain very high levels \\n(typically 35 g sugar/330 ml can) and the \\nsugar is rapidly absorbed by the body. \\nn Fruit juices – surprisingly contain the same \\namount of sugar as soft drinks.\\nn Sweets – they provide sugar and no other \\nnutrients.\\nn Biscuits and cakes – these are high in sugar \\nand refined carbohydrate.\\nn Low-fat or reduced-fat foods – biscuits, \\ndesserts, etc. that have the fat removed  \\nare often very high in sugar.\\n2. Drink water instead of soft drinks and  \\nfruit juice.\\n3. Try substituting some of the sugar in  \\nrecipes with natural sweet ingredients  \\nsuch as cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, almond \\nextract, ginger or lemon. \\n4. Simply avoid processed foods and satisfy your \\nsweet tooth with fresh fruit instead.\\n02bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   85 19/12/2013   22:46'),\n",

It slows the rate that foods pass through your \\ndigestive system and stabilises blood sugar levels. One study has shown that \\npeople who increased their fibre intake for 4 months ate fewer calories and lost \\nan average of 5 lb. For each 1 g increase in total fibre consumed, their weight \\ndecreased by 0.25 kg and fat decreased by 0.25 percentage point (Tucker and \\nThomas, 2009).\\n Also, fibre-rich foods require more chewing, which helps slow down your \\neating and stops you over-eating. Eating slowly gives your brain the chance to \\nrecognise that you’re full.\\n Whole fruits are more filling than dried or pureed versions and vastly more \\nfilling than juice. You can eat an awful lot of apples, for example, without taking in \\na lot of calories. They make your stomach feel full because they take up so much \\nspace. But a glass of apple juice doesn’t satisfy your appetite in the same way, \\neven though it has the same number of calories.\\n7. Track your progress\\nYou can track your progress by measuring your waist circumference and weighing \\nyourself once a week. Focusing only on your weight and weighing yourself \\nevery day can be misleading and reduce your motivation. There is little point in \\nmeasuring yourself more often than weekly as your weight can fluctuate day to \\nday depending on hydration levels. \\n When you stand on the scales you are measuring muscles, bone and internal \\norgans as well as fat. You may gain muscle weight but lose fat, but this won’t \\nregister on the scales. Using either your waist circumference or your body fat \\npercentage will help you track your fat loss and give you a more accurate idea of \\nyour progress.\\nWaist circumference\\nYour waist circumference is a good reflection of your abdominal fat and your total \\nbody fat percentage, and studies show it is more accurate than BMI in predicting \\nyour risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes (Janssen et al., 2002). Ideally your \\nwaist should be less than 80 cm (for women) and less than 94 cm (for men). \\n A loss of 1 cm around your waist equates to fat loss of approxi  mately 1 \\nkg. Put the measuring tape around your middle, slightly above your navel \\n– at the midpoint between your hip bone and the bottom of your ribs. \\nExhale and relax – don’t suck in your stomach.\\n02bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   86 19/12/2013   22:46'),\n",

These techniques will tell you how much of you is muscle and how \\nmuch is fat:\\nn Skin-fold measurements using callipers should be carried out by a trained \\nperson who would measure the thickness of the layer of fat beneath the skin \\nat various sites of the body. It works on the theory that 50 per cent of total \\nbody fat is stored under the skin. Most assessments involve measurements \\nat four sites: the triceps, biceps, below the shoulder blades, and mid-way \\nbetween the hip and navel. The accuracy depends on the level of skill of the \\nperson taking the measurements. It is less accurate for very lean and obese \\nindividuals.\\nn Bioelectrical impedance measures the resistance to a small electrical current \\npassed through two points of the body. The more fat present, the greater \\nthe resis tance. A person’s hydration status (and, for women, stage of the \\nmenstrual cycle) can affect the reading. It is also less accurate for very lean \\nand very overweight individuals.\\n8. Don’t skip breakfast\\nStarting the day with a healthy, filling breakfast dramatically increases your \\nchances of eating healthily throughout the day. It helps curb your hunger so you \\nwill go on to eat fewer calories at lunch and dinner. If you don’t eat break fast, you \\nare more likely to over-eat later in the day as your appetite increases. \\n As a general rule, the more calories you eat before midday the less you will eat \\nlater on in the day. In other words, eating early in the day reduces your appetite \\nat subsequent meals. A study found that women dieters who ate 700 calories for \\nbreakfast followed by smaller meals ate fewer calories overall and lost significantly \\nmore weight over 12 weeks than those who ate a smaller breakfast of just 200 \\ncalories followed by bigger meals (Jakubowicz et al., 2013). They also had a bigger \\nreduction in their waist circumference. \\n It makes sense to eat more food when your energy needs are greatest and \\nless when your needs are lower. For most people, this means eating early in the \\nday. Breakfast therefore provides your body with fuel when you need it most. \\nThe calories you eat at this time will be used to fuel your daily activities and \\nworkouts, instead of being stored as body fat (as they are if eaten in the evening). \\nWhat you eat for breakfast is important too. Researchers have found that eating  \\nhigh-protein foods for breakfast significantly improves appetite control and \\nstops food cravings later in the day (Leidy et al., 2013). Those who ate foods such \\nQ&A\\nWill cutting more calories help me \\nlose weight faster?\\nGoing on a strict diet may cause the \\npounds to drop off but it can also \\nmake you feel lethargic and weak, \\nhindering your per formance. Worse \\nstill, your body can end up hoarding \\ninstead of burning fat. A sudden \\ndrop in calories sends a message \\nto the body that starvation might \\nbe imminent, causing the body to \\nconserve energy. As your body \\ngoes into survival mode, adapting \\nto survive on a lower-calorie intake, \\nthe rate at which you burn energy \\nslows down. This means that when \\nyou stop dieting, you are likely to \\nput the weight back on. To com-\\npensate for the low-calorie intake, \\nyour body will start to break down \\nmuscle tissue for fuel. This means \\nthat you can end up losing muscle \\nas well as fat. You should never cut \\nyour current calorie intake by more \\nthan 15 per cent.\\n02bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   87 19/12/2013   22:46'),\n",

Get enough sleep\\nGetting enough sleep is also important when it comes to weight control. Studies \\nhave shown that the less you sleep, the more you are likely to eat during the day \\n(St-Onge et al., 2012). This is because lack of sleep boosts levels of the hormone \\nghrelin, which makes you feel hungry, while lowering levels of the hormone \\nleptin, which makes you feel full (Spiegel et al., 2004). This hormonal imbalance \\nsends a signal to the brain that more food is needed when, in fact, enough has \\nbeen eaten. Research at the University of Chicago shows that sleeping for 4 hours \\nor less increases levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which makes you feel \\nhungry (Leproult and Van Cauter, 2010).\\n In one 2009 US study, those who averaged 5.5 hours’ sleep ate 221 more \\ncalories than those who slept about 8.5 hours (Nedeltcheva, 2009). Although they \\ndidn’t eat bigger meals they did snack more in the evening than the well-rested \\ngroup, and consumed more carbohydrate. Another study in the American Journal \\nof Epidemiology found that women who got less than 5 hours’ sleep were 33 per \\ncent more likely to gain weight over 16 years than those that get 7–8 hours’ sleep \\n(Patel et al., 2006). People who get 5 hours’ sleep gained 1 kg during the 16-year \\nstudy, although their calorie intake was no higher than those getting more sleep. \\nResearchers speculate that a lack of sleep somehow depresses your metabolism \\nso you burn fewer calories throughout the day.\\n Here are some ways to help you get a better night’s sleep:\\n1. Get up at the same time, even at weekends. In the long term, this will help the \\nbody get into a regular sleep pattern.\\n2. Avoid daytime naps and go to bed only when you are sleepy.\\n3. Avoid caffeine after 2 p.m. – it takes time for caffeine to leave the body.\\n02bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   88 19/12/2013   22:46'),\n",

Limit your alcohol intake 3 hours before bedtime.\\xa0While alcohol might make \\nyou feel relaxed, it disrupts your sleep and you are likely to wake up feeling  \\nless refreshed.\\n5. Limit exercise in the 4 hours before bedtime. Physical activity can make it \\ndifficult to get to sleep for several hours afterwards.\\n6. Spend as much time as possible in daylight (at least 15 minutes every day). \\nThis is good for your circadian rhythm (your ‘body clock’).\\n7. Make sure that your bed is comfortable, your bedroom is dark enough, and \\nthat it stays at a reasonable temperature. \\n8. Avoid television and laptops in bed. \\n9. Have a hot bath an hour before bedtime – the cooling down after a bath \\nmakes you sleepy.\\n10. Do the right type of exercise \\nExercise is an important part of any fat loss programme. Not only does it burn \\ncalories but it also has a favourable effect on your body composition, helping \\nmaintain muscle while losing fat. Some people find they become hungrier \\nand eat more when they begin a new exercise programme (the ‘compensation  \\neffect’), but you can avoid this by upping your protein intake. Protein increases \\nsatiety more than carbohydrate or fat (see page 84). Also, by eating real food and \\navoiding processed foods, you’ll find your appetite automatically adjusts. \\n For the best fat-burning results, make sure you include both resis  tance exer-\\ncise and cardiovascular (endurance or aerobic) exercise in your weekly schedule. \\nThe American College of Sports Medicine recommends two weight training \\nsessions a week in addition to five 20–40-minute sessions of aerobic activity.\\nresistance training\\nThe most effective strategy for building or toning muscles and burning fat \\nsimultaneously is resistance or weight training. This doesn’t neces sarily mean \\nlifting heavy weights – conditioning exercises using light or moderate weights \\ntone muscle and prevents the loss of lean body tissue when you’re losing fat. The \\nAmerican College of Sports Medicine recommend 2–3 days a week for beginners, \\nprogressing to 4–5 times a week for the more advanced (Garber et al., 2009). In \\ngeneral, train each muscle group for 2–4 sets of exercises with a weight you can \\nlift only 8–12 times, taking 30 seconds’ rest between sets. You won’t necessarily \\nburn more calories lifting weights than doing aerobic exercise, but the increased \\nmuscle mass you develop as a result will improve your body.\\n02bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   89 19/12/2013   22:46'),\n",

Try running, elliptical training machines, \\nswimming, cycling, fast walking and group exercise classes. Vary your activities \\nso you don’t become bored. Remember, the higher the resistance, the more \\nmuscle you will build, so high-resistance activities such as rowing, stair-climbing, \\nincline running and hard cycling are good for strengthening as well as defining \\nmuscles. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends 150 minutes per \\nweek to improve your health (Donnelly et al., 2009) or 200–300 minutes to lose \\nweight. That’s equiv alent to 5 sessions of 30 minutes (for health) or 5 sessions of \\n60 minutes (weight loss). \\n A sensible target would be 20–40 minutes per session, 3–5 times per week, \\nbut don’t overdo it. Increase the intensity and duration of your sessions gradually, \\naiming for 60 minutes 5 times a week.\\nten more fat-loss tips\\n1. Plan ahead\\nPlan your meals for the week and work out exactly what you need. If you make a \\nlist before you go shopping, you’re more likely to stick to it. Also, plan ning ahead \\nmeans you won’t get home from work tired and hungry only to discover there’s \\nnothing healthy in your fridge to eat.\\n2. Limit your food choices\\nResearch carried out at Tufts University in Massachusetts found that when people \\nare presented with a wider variety of foods, they eat considerably more (McCrory \\net al., 1999). Also, when eating a single food, your eating rate slows down, you \\nare satiated more quickly and, therefore, you will eat less. The pleasure of eating \\na food increases up to the third or fourth bite then drops off. If you have lots of \\ndifferent foods on your plate you prolong the sensory pleasure, which stops you \\nfeeling full. The message here is to simplify your diet: place fewer types of food \\non your plate.\\n3. Practise portion control\\nIt may sound obvious, but larger portions make you eat more. Researchers have \\nfound that when people are given larger food portions they eat more than \\nthose given a small portion. In one study at the University of New South Wales, \\nQ&A\\nWhich burns more calories: weights \\nor cardio vascular training?\\nDuring resistance training you burn \\nfewer calories than cardiovascular \\ntraining – around 250 calories vs. \\n500 calories per hour (on average). \\nBoth exercise modes have a similar \\n‘afterburn’ – i.e. the number of \\ncalories in the period immediately \\nafter exercise. So if you have only \\na limited amount of time available \\nto exercise, then cardiovascular \\nexercise is probably best for weight \\nloss. However, it is better to have a \\nmix of both resistance and cardio-\\nvascular exercise – this way you will \\nburn fat and build muscle, which \\nwill keep you strong and healthy \\nand prevent injury. One study found \\nthat people who did a combi nation \\nof cardiovascular and resistance  \\nexercise lost more fat than those  \\ndoing cardio-only exercise, but  \\nalso gained more muscle (Willis  \\net al., 2012). \\n02bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   90 19/12/2013   22:46'),\n",

This amounted to about 87 \\ncalories of extra calories. Another study at Cornell University in New York found \\nthat people ate 45 per cent more popcorn when given a large portion (Wansink \\net al., 2005). Even when the popcorn was stale, they still ate 33 per cent more. \\n The size of your plate, the bowls you serve yourself from, and the size of \\nthe utensils you use can also make you eat more. Switching to eating from a \\nsmaller plate makes the amount you put on it look larger and means you will \\nautomatically eat less. So, try serving yourself from smaller bowls and using \\nsmaller serving spoons as a lesson in portion control. \\n4. Start with salad or soup\\nAccording to a 2004 study at Pennsylvania State Univer  sity, eating a large \\nportion of low-energy-density foods, such as salad or fruit, as a starter can cut the \\nnumber of calories eaten during the main meal by 12 per cent (Rolls et al., 2004). \\nThe fibre and water in the salad/fruit takes the edge off the appetite, causing \\nyou to eat less of the higher-calorie foods. Starting your meal with a bowl of \\nchunky, fibre-rich soup can cut your calorie intake by 20 per cent, according to a \\nstudy by the University of Pennsylvania (Flood and Rolls, 2007). The idea is that \\nthe fibre in soup fills you up meaning you’ll eat less of the higher-calorie foods  \\nthat follow. \\n5. Eat without distractions\\nDon’t eat in front of the TV, or while you are working at the computer because \\nyou are less likely to notice what you are eating. Studies have shown that the \\ndistraction of TV postpones the point at which people stop eating, with TV \\nwatchers eating approximately 12–15 per cent more than those who do not eat \\nin front of the TV. In addition, people who watch TV for more than 4 hours a day \\nconsume one-third more calories because they have more opportunity to nibble \\nand less opportunity to exercise. \\n Making time for formal meals at a table rather than grabbing food while on \\nthe run or in front of a screen could help you to cut down on unhealthy snacking. \\nAnother study found that when women ate five biscuits while playing a computer \\ngame they felt less full and wanted more. Those given the same amount of food \\nwithout any distraction felt sated (Brunstrom and Mitchell, 2006).\\n6. Eat mindfully\\nYou’ll eat fewer calories if you sit down and take time to eat your meal rather than \\neating on the go. Eating too fast almost certainly leads to over-eating. It means \\nmytH: BuILDInG muscLe \\nspeeDs your metABoLIsm\\nContrary to popular belief, building \\nmuscle doesn’t increase your meta -\\nbolism or add significantly to your \\ndaily calorie burn. The oft-quoted \\nstatistic that a pound of muscle \\nburns 30–50 calories/day has no \\nscientific basis. In fact, muscle burns \\njust 6 calories/lb (13 calories/kg). \\nYour basal metabolic rate (the \\nnumber of calories burned at rest) is \\nlargely determined by genetics and \\ntotal body weight, and is not signifi-\\ncantly altered by diet or exer cise. \\nThat makes sense when you consider \\nthat your muscles account for only \\n28 per cent of the calories you burn \\nat rest – compared to your heart,  \\nkidneys, liver and brain which com-\\nbine to make up as much as 70–80 \\nper cent of your BMR. \\nHowever, that’s not to say you \\nneed not bother adding muscle.  \\nResistance training has many other \\nadvantages – it improves athletic \\nperformance, makes you look better, \\nhelps stop the natural loss of muscle \\nwith ageing, makes the chores of \\neveryday life easier, and can reduce \\nthe risk of injury. Additionally an \\nhour of resistance training burns \\n250–400 calories (depen ding how \\nmuch rest you take between sets), \\nplus you burn a few more calories \\npost-exercise (‘afterburn’).\\n02bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   91 19/12/2013   22:46'),\n",

Mindful eating – eating \\nslowly and genuinely relishing each bite – has its origins in Buddhist \\nteachings, where eating food is considered a form of meditation. It will \\ncurb your desire to eat more than you need. It’s about experiencing \\nfood more intensely, taking time to eat food carefully and paying \\nattention to the colours, smells, textures, flavours, temperatures, and \\neven the sounds of your food. When you eat, just eat. Turn off the \\nelectronica and focus on the food. Take a (small) bite of food and \\nthen put your knife and fork down. Chew patiently and contemplate \\nthe flavour and texture of your food, aiming for 25 to 30 chews for \\neach mouthful.\\n7. Cut down on alcohol\\nAlcohol calories count too: if you consume several alcoholic drinks \\nin an evening, they can sabotage your fat-loss plan. Alcohol calories \\ncan’t be stored and have to be used as they are consumed – this \\nmeans that calories excess to require ments from other foods get \\nstored as fat instead. Alcoholic drinks are often high in calories, for \\nexample one small glass of wine con tains 120 calories and a bottle of \\nlager contains 130 calories.\\n8. Recognise thirst\\nMany people confuse thirst with hunger. It’s hard to know sometimes \\nwhether it’s really food or water your body needs. Both thirst and \\nhunger signals are con trolled in the same area of the brain, so it sends \\nthe same signal whether you are hungry or thirsty (Mattes, 2010). If \\nyou don’t recognise the sensation of thirst, you may assume that you \\nare hungry and eat instead of drinking water. Next time you’re feeling \\npeckish, drink a glass of water and wait 10 minutes to see if you are  \\nstill hungry.\\n9. Avoid liquid calories\\nLiquid foods move through the body quickly and don’t provide the \\nsame sense of satisfaction as solid foods. That’s why 100 calories \\nof liquid don’t satisfy you as 100 calories of solid food would, even \\nthough they contain the same number of calories. \\nmytH: eAtInG FreQuentLy Boosts \\nyour metABoLIsm\\nEating several small meals through the day  \\n(‘grazing’) instead of two or three does not  \\nincrease your meta bolism or help you lose fat  \\nfaster. In one study, there was no difference \\nin weight loss between overweight people \\nwho consumed 3 meals a day and those who \\nconsumed the same calories as 6 meals a day \\n(Cameron et al., 2010). Other studies have found \\nno corre lation between metabolic rate and eating \\nfrequency – people who ate 6 times a day did not \\nhave a higher metabolic rate than those who ate 2 \\ntimes a day (Taylor and Garrow, 2001). Although \\neating temp orarily increases the metabolism \\n(the ‘thermic effect of food’), this will not greatly \\nincrease your total daily calorie burn. A review of \\n179 studies concluded that eating frequency has \\nno effect on weight loss (Palmer et al., 2009). \\nHowever, eating several small meals a \\nday does have other benefits. It lowers blood \\ncholesterol levels, improves appetite control and \\ncurbs your hunger. In one study, people who ate \\nseveral meals had less hunger than those who ate \\nthe same amount of food in just 2 meals (Stote et \\nal., 2007). This could help prevent over-eating. \\nWhen athletes were given 250-calorie snacks, \\nthey ate fewer calories at mealtimes, gained lean \\nmass and lost fat (Bernardot et al., 2005).

There are \\ntwo plans providing approximately 2,000 and 1,800 calories suitable for \\nindi viduals weighing more than 75 kg and less than 75 kg respectively, \\nand exercising at moderate intensity for approximately one hour a day. \\nIf you exercise longer than an hour a day or at a very high intensity, then \\nyou should increase the portion sizes to take account of your greater \\ncalorie expenditure. Similarly, if you exercise for less than an hour or \\nat a low intensity, then you should reduce the portion sizes. There is \\nalso a 1,500-calorie menu plan suitable for rest days when you don’t  \\ndo any training. \\n You should use the core menu plan as a template for developing \\nyour individual daily eating plan. Where the menu plan gives a choice \\nof food type (e.g. ‘carbohydrate’), simply pick your preferred option \\n(e.g. pasta or potatoes) or substitute an equivalent (high-carbo hydrate) \\nfood (e.g. quinoa or noodles). Try to vary your choice of fresh fruit \\nand vegetables as much as possible according to what’s in season as \\nthis will give you a greater range of micronutrients, antioxidants and \\nphytonutrients.

The basic \\ncon cept of HIIT is to train at different speeds \\nfor a number of intervals. Researchers at \\nLaval University in Quebec found that 9 times \\nmore fat was lost in the group that used HIIT, \\ncompared to the group that used traditional \\nsteady-intensity cardio (Tremblay et al., \\n1994). It also increases your metabolic rate for \\nthe following 24 hours. In other words, your \\nbody’s fat-burning process continues long \\nafter your workout, even when you are at rest. \\nHIIT can be performed with a variety of \\nactivities or machines – running, swimming, \\ntreadmills, bikes, ellip tical trainers or skipping-\\nropes.

Or maybe you find it difficult to build muscle without gaining \\nfat and need to achieve better muscle definition. Either way, the answer \\nlies in devising an eating plan that allows you to put on muscle without \\nunwanted fat. \\n To gain muscle and strength, it’s necessary to combine a healthy \\nfood intake with a consistent resistance training programme. Without \\nboth, you will not gain muscle. Resis tance training is the first part of the \\nprocess: it breaks down muscle tissue, providing a stimulus for muscle \\ngrowth and creating a demand for additional protein (as well as other \\nnutrients). The second part of the process is recovery; this is when \\nmuscle growth takes place and when your diet becomes paramount. \\n Getting the right amount of calories, protein, carbohydrate and fat \\nas well as vitamins and minerals is the key to optimal muscle growth, \\nrecovery and performance. This chapter gives you information on \\nwhat, when and how much to eat before and after training, and helps \\nyou devise a daily eating plan that supports your muscle-building \\nprogramme. \\nWhy do some people gain muscle more \\neasily than others?\\nThe amount of muscle weight you can expect to gain depends on several genetic \\nfactors, including your body type, muscle fibre mix, the arrangement of your \\nmotor units and your hormonal balance, as well as your training programme  \\nand diet. \\n An ectomorph (naturally slim build with long lean limbs, narrow shoulders \\nand hips) will find it harder to gain muscle than a mesomorph (muscular, athletic \\nbuild with wide shoulders and narrow hips). An endomorph (stocky, rounded \\nbuild with wide shoulders and hips and an even distribution of fat) gains both fat \\nand muscle readily. \\nThe science of muscle \\nproTein synThesis\\nTo build muscle you need to \\ncombine a resistance training \\nprogramme with a healthy intake of \\nnutrients. The idea is to stress the \\nmuscles just hard enough during \\nyour workout to break down muscle \\nproteins and cause very small (micro) \\ntears in the fibres. This ‘damage’ \\ntriggers muscle protein synthesis \\n(MPS), or muscle growth (Rennie \\nand Kipton, 2000). After your work-\\nout, the muscle releases cytokines \\n(hormone-like molecules) that signal \\nmuscle repair for up to 48 hours. \\nThese activate various pathways \\nsuch as MTOR and AKT that begin \\nthe process of MPS. MTOR, which \\nis short for the Mammalian Target \\nof Rapamyacin, is the functioning \\nunit that senses nutrient and oxygen \\nlevels in cells. AKT signals cell \\ndivision and growth. These pathways \\nenable amino acids to pass from the \\nbloodstream into the muscle cell \\nand then get transported within the \\ncell to where they will be assembled \\ninto new muscle proteins. Thus, \\nthese new proteins are added to the \\nmuscle fibres, making the muscle \\nstronger and denser.\\n03bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   99 20/12/2013   13:29'),\n",

For the same effort, they \\ngenerate a higher force output than the average person. This creates a bigger \\nstimulus for muscle growth. \\n On the other hand, people with a higher natural level of the male (anabolic) \\nsex hormones, such as testosterone, will also gain muscle faster. That is why \\nwomen cannot achieve the muscle mass or size of men unless they take anabolic \\nsteroids. \\nhow fast can i expect to gain weight? \\nWhen it comes to muscle gain there is no quick fix that will allow you to pack \\non more muscle quickly.

Mass gains of 20 per cent of your starting \\nbody weight are common after the first year of training, but the rate of weight \\ngain will gradually drop off over the years as you approach your genetic potential. \\n Remember that gaining muscle is a long-term goal and not something \\nthat can be achieved in a few weeks.

Obviously, your age, genetics, body type, training \\nexperience and work ethic will affect your gains. Women usually experience \\nabout 50–75 per cent of the gains of men – i.e. ¼–¾ kg/month – partly due to \\ntheir smaller initial body weight and smaller muscle mass, and partly due to lower \\nlevels of anabolic hormones. It’s better to keep focused and realistic by training \\nhard, eating healthily and ensuring you recover properly; this will result in you \\nachieving a more muscular physique.\\nhow many calories?\\nIn order to build muscle you need to consume more calories in a day than your \\nbody burns, because building new muscle requires extra energy (calories). This \\ncannot be over-emphasised! One study found that athletes following a resistance-\\ntraining pro gramme gained the same amount of body weight and muscle mass \\nwhether they got extra calories from protein or carbohydrate (Rozenek et al., \\n2002). However, it is better these additional calories come from a balanced ratio \\nof carbohydrate, protein and fat, and not ‘junk food calories’ . \\n To gain lean weight at the optimal rate you should begin by increasing \\nyour usual daily calorie intake by 20 per cent. Of course, this assumes that you \\nknow what your maintenance calories actually are. If you do, just add 20 per \\ncent. If not, estimate your calories using the formula on page 4. Or use this  \\nquick estimate:\\nTo gain weight: 42–48 calories/kg of body weight for weight gain \\nTo maintain weight: 35–40 calories/kg of body weight \\nFor example, if you normally consume 2,700 kcal daily without gaining weight, to \\ngain muscle mass you will need to eat 2,700 x 1.2 = 3,240 kcal. \\n However, you may need to adjust your calories depending on your indi vidual \\nmetabolism. Bear in mind that not all of the extra calories will be turned into  \\nmuscle. Some of them will be ‘wasted’ as heat as your metabolic rate increases \\nwhen you over-consume calories (around 7 per cent). This is called adaptive \\nther mo   genesis and may partly explain why some people (ectomorphs) struggle \\nto gain weight despite eating large quantities of food! Similarly, when you cut \\ncalories to lose weight, your metabolic rate drops to conserve energy. \\n Another reason why some people find it difficult to gain weight (‘hard gainers’) \\nis non-exercise activity thermogenesis (‘NEAT’), which are the calories you burn \\ndoing activities that aren’t exercise, for example, fidgeting, moving around. Hard \\ngainers usually have a high NEAT energy expenditure – they burn lots of calories \\nthrough excess activity. \\n03bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   101 20/12/2013   13:29'),\n",

The problem is some of \\nthese excess calories will go towards the repair and growth of new muscle, and \\nsome of the calories may spill over and be stored as fat. It’s possible to minimise \\nfat gain while gaining muscle, but don’t expect to reduce it – you cannot build \\nmuscle and lose fat at the same time. Instead, you should prioritise your goal, \\ni.e. build muscle or lose fat and focus on one at a time. The trick is to keep your \\ncalorie surplus high enough for muscle growth, but not so high that it results in \\nfat storage. Follow these simple rules:\\nn Get your calories from real foods – it’s far harder to gain fat if you focus on ‘real’ \\nfoods, i.e. minimally processed foods such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans, \\nlentils, nuts, seeds, fruit, vegetables, whole grains, milk, cheese, yoghurt, \\nbutter, olive oil and butter. These foods increase satiety and reduce hunger \\n(for more on this see Chapter 4). \\nn Don’t go overboard with your calorie surplus – most people only need a \\nsurplus of 300–500 calories a day. Going any higher than this is likely to start a \\nspill over and your body may store these extra calories as fat.\\nn Track your calories – use a calorie counter app such as myfitnesspal or a simple \\npad and pen to keep a food diary. You don’t have to be very accurate, but you \\ndo need to have a good idea of your daily calorie intake.\\nn Train for muscle gain – an intense, effective workout routine is essential to \\nstim u late growth and put your calorie surplus to use. If you don’t follow a \\nconsistent training programme, then the extra calories you consume will turn \\ninto fat. \\nn Include some cardiovascular exercise – incorporating a few short (10–20 \\nminutes), high-intensity interval cardiovascular sessions a week is a good way \\nto keep those unwanted fat gains under control. This kind of exercise supports \\nmuscle growth while eliminating excess fat storage.\\nhow much carbohydrate should i consume?\\nYou need to consume enough carbohydrate to achieve high muscle glycogen \\nlevels, the main fuel for resistance training. Eating too little carbohydrate means \\ntraining with low levels of muscle glycogen, which risks excessive protein (muscle) \\nbreakdown. \\n A good guide as to whether you are eating enough carbohydrate is your \\nperformance. If you get easily fatigued and struggle to complete your workout, \\nor you find you’re not able to progress your workouts by lifting heavier weights, \\n03bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   102 20/12/2013   13:29'),\n",

Try increasing your carbohydrate intake by an extra 50–100 g \\ndaily to restore glycogen levels.\\n On the other hand, eating too much carbohydrate won’t give you extra \\nenergy, nor help you train harder. Ironically, you may feel more tired and lethargic, \\nparticularly if you eat too much sugar and refined carbohydrate (‘white’ bread, \\npasta, rice and cereals) before your workout. These foods can spike your insulin \\nlevels, which results in lower blood glucose levels. This rebound effect can make \\nyou feel tired, weak and lightheaded. Instead, eat a low-GI meal that includes \\nprotein and fat as well as carbohydrate 2–4 hours before exercise. If you need an \\nenergy boost before training and you haven’t eaten for more than 4 hours, then \\nhave a smaller meal or snack. \\n Once your glycogen stores are filled, excess carbohydrate are converted into \\nfat, meaning that you might put on weight. Try to listen to your body and you’ll \\nsoon find the balance between too little and too much carbohydrate.\\n Table 1.1 on page 4 gives the carbohydrate intake for different training \\nschedules. In general, carbohydrate requirements increase with increasing \\ntraining duration and intensity (Rodriguez et al., 2009; IOC, 2011). So, the longer \\nand more intense your training sessions, the more carbohydrate you will need \\nto fuel your workout. However, you should factor in rest periods between sets – \\nwhile they are essential for recuperation, they don’t strictly count towards your \\ndaily activity tally. For example, in a 2-hour gym session, you may be spending \\nonly 45 minutes training, and 75 minutes resting. Your daily carbo hydrate require-\\nment would be 5–7 g/kg of body weight/day. This equates to (5 x 70) to (7 x 70) \\n= 350–490 g for a person weighing 70 kg. Even if you’re lifting heavy weights, \\nthis amount of carbohydrate will be more than enough to fuel a typical workout. \\nHowever, this is only a guideline and you should adjust this according to your \\nspecific training goals, how active you are during the rest of the day, and how you \\nfeel during and after training. \\nProtein is key\\nProtein is the next most important part of your weight-training diet. The building \\nblocks of protein, amino acids, are used for repairing and rebuilding the muscle \\nfibres that you have damaged during your workout. \\n Resistance training breaks down muscle tissue and thereby creates a demand \\nfor additional protein. Since protein helps muscles recover faster, athletes who \\nconsume the right amount will optimise their muscle gains and are less likely to \\nget injured, according to the International Society of Sports Nutrition (Campbell \\n03bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   103 05/01/2014   22:15'),\n",

What’s more, a high-protein intake \\nhas been shown to help maintain a strong immune system.\\nHow much protein?\\nIt is widely accepted that athletes have higher protein requirements than the \\ngeneral population (Rodriquez et al., 2009; Phillips et al., 2007; Campbell et al., \\n2007). The exact amount of protein necessary for muscle building has been hotly \\ndebated for many years, but the scientific consensus from the IOC Conference on \\nNutrition in Sport 2010 is an intake of 1.3 g–1.8 g protein/kg of body weight per \\nday for athletes generally; with intakes at the higher end of this range (1.6–1.8 \\ng) for strength and power athletes (Phillips and van Loon, 2011). This trans lates \\nto 112–126 g daily for a 70 kg person, considerably more than the Guideline \\nDaily Amount (GDA) for the general population (45 g for \\nwomen and 55 g for men). This extra protein is needed to \\ncompensate for the increased breakdown of protein during \\nexercise and to facilitate muscle repair and recovery after  \\nintense training.\\n A longer-term effect of continued resistance training is \\nthat it increases protein retention. In other words, resistance \\ntraining reduces the relative amount of protein consumed \\nthat is lost in urine. So, experienced strength athletes actually \\nneed less protein weight for weight than novices. \\n Most people eat more protein than they actually need, \\nso deficiencies are rare and protein supplements are not \\nnecessary – you can still get these levels of protein from a \\nbalanced diet. You can get more than enough protein from \\n3–4 daily portions of chicken, fish, dairy products, eggs and \\npulses. Even vegetarians can meet their protein needs by \\neating dairy products, eggs, and non-animal proteins such as \\nbeans, lentils, nuts and soya.\\n Eating too little protein occasionally isn’t a problem \\nas the body can adapt to low intakes in the short term by \\nrecycling amino acids (rather than excreting them). But, in \\nthe long term, low protein intakes can cause fatigue and slow \\nrecovery after workouts. It can result in a loss of muscle tissue  \\nand strength. \\nThe funcTions of \\nproTein\\nProtein consists of chains of amino \\nacids that combine in various ways \\nto form part of the structure of \\nevery cell in your body, including \\nmuscles, tendons, skin and hair.  \\nIt also serves other functions \\nincluding enzyme, hormone and \\nantibody production.\\n03bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   104 20/12/2013   13:29'),\n",

However, extra protein won’t give you any perfor-\\nmance benefits. Studies have demonstrated that eating more than you need for \\ndaily repair does not result in additional muscle growth, strength, stamina or \\nspeed (Lemon et al., 1992). \\n A high-protein diet is unlikely to pose any health risk provided the amount of \\nprotein consumed isn’t excessive. Any protein that isn’t needed for tissue repair \\nand growth is partly excreted (in the form of urea) and partly used as a fuel source. \\nIt’s a myth that high-protein diets cause kidney damage – there’s no evidence \\nto support this belief (Tipton and Wolfe, 2007). It stems from studies that found \\npeople with pre-existing kidney problems experienced stress on their kidneys \\nwhen processing protein in their diet. But, for healthy people, excess protein does \\nnot harm the kidneys. \\n It’s also a myth that excess protein makes you fat – but eating excess  \\ncal ories will. It’s harder for the body to convert excess protein calories to fat than \\nto convert excess calories from carbohydrate or fat. When you consume pro  -\\ntein, 25–30 per cent of the calories are lost as heat in the process of diges  tion. \\nAlso, protein induces greater satiety than carbohydrate or fat, as it raises levels of \\nsatiety hormones such as glucagon, so it’s actually quite difficult to eat too many \\ncalories on a high-protein diet (Halton and Hu, 2004).\\nWhy is leucine important for muscle building?\\nScientists have discovered that one of the essential amino acids, leucine, can help \\nspeed recovery and stimulate muscle growth after exercise and is particu larly \\nimportant for those wanting to build muscle mass. It acts as a signal to the muscle \\ncells to make new muscle proteins; in other words, it kick-starts the process of \\nregenerating and building muscles (Norton and Layman, 2006). Leucine activates \\na compound called mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), a molecular switch \\nthat turns on the machinery that manufactures muscle proteins.\\n Low leucine concentrations signal to mTOR that there is not enough dietary \\nprotein present to synthesise new muscle protein, so mTOR deacti  vates. High \\nleucine levels signal to mTOR that there is sufficient dietary protein to synthesise \\nnew muscle protein, so mTOR ‘turns on’ . So, leucine is critical for muscle growth \\nbecause without it, protein synthesis cannot take place.  \\nfoods supplying 2 g  \\nleucine and 20 g proTein\\n600 ml milk\\n85 g Cheddar cheese\\n450 g plain yoghurt \\n3 eggs\\n85 g meat or chicken\\n100 g fish\\n17 g whey powder\\n03bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   105 20/12/2013   13:29'),\n",

It \\nis found widely in foods, the best sources being animal (high-quality) proteins: \\neggs, dairy products, meat, fish and poultry. It is also found in high concentrations \\nin whey protein. You’ll need around 2 g leucine to get maximum muscle-building \\nbenefits; that’s the amount found in approximately 20 g of an animal-protein \\nsource. The box on the previous page shows the amounts of various foods that \\nyou would need to consume to get 2 g leucine and 20 g protein. \\nWhen is the best time to consume protein?\\nThe timing of your protein intake around exercise sessions is important. Many \\nstudies have shown that athletes gain more muscle when they eat some of \\ntheir protein before and also after training than when they consume the same \\namount of protein each day but consume none before and after their work outs \\n(Willoughby et al., 2007; Tipton et al., 2003).   \\n After intense exercise, the rate of protein manufacture is low and pro  tein \\nbreakdown high. However, you can shift this balance and kick-start muscle \\nprotein recovery by supplying your muscles with approximately 20–25 g protein \\n(as well as carbohydrate) during the 2-hour post-exercise period. Studies suggest \\nthat this amount of protein ensures that enough amino acid building blocks are \\npresent to repair muscle tissue (Moore et al., 2009). \\n A review of studies on protein needs by researchers at McMaster University, \\nCanada, concluded that protein should be consumed with carbohydrate in a 3 to 1 \\nratio after exercise (Tipton et al., 1999). They found that \\nthis particular protein and carbohydrate combination \\nwas more effective in promoting muscle repair and \\nglycogen storage than protein or carbohydrate alone. \\n Consuming protein with carbohydrate pro  motes a \\ngreater release of insulin, which stimulates the trans -\\nport of glucose and amino acids into muscle cells. The \\nmore insulin is present in the bloodstream, the more \\nglucose and amino acids can be carried into the muscles \\nfor glycogen and protein manufacture. When protein \\nis consumed with carbohydrate, the insulin response \\ncan nearly double that invoked by carbohydrate \\nalone. Insulin also blunts the rise in cortisol that would \\nmyTh: you cannoT \\nabsorb more Than 25 g \\nproTein in one meal\\nAlthough only 20–25 g protein \\nis needed for muscle repair and \\ngrowth (Phillips and van Loon, \\n2011), it doesn’t mean that you \\ncannot digest and absorb more \\nthan this in one sitting. You will \\ndigest and absorb all of the protein \\nyou eat, whether it’s 25 g or 50 g. \\nIt’s just that not all of it will be  \\nused for muscle building. Any-\\nthing surplus to this will be used \\nfor other functions in the body or \\nbe used as a fuel source. What’s \\nmost important is that you meet \\nyour total daily protein require-\\nment, and that you consume 20–25 \\ng immediately after training when \\nyour muscles are most receptive to \\namino acids. \\n03bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   106 20/12/2013   13:29'),\n",

Cortisol suppresses protein synthesis and stimulates \\nprotein breakdown. \\nHow much protein should I consume after training?\\nCanadian researchers found that 20–25 g is the optimal level for muscle growth \\nimmediately after a weights workout (Moore et al., 2009). When athletes con -\\nsumed less than 20 g they gained less muscle; when they consumed more than \\nthis amount they experienced no further muscle gains. However, it’s best to think \\nof 20–25 g as a ballpark figure. If you weigh more than 85 kg (the weight of the \\nathletes in the study) then you will need more, if you weigh less than 85 kg you \\nmay need less. \\nWhat types of protein are best for muscle growth? \\nMilk, whey, casein (the latter two are derived from milk), egg, \\nmeat, poultry and fish provide all the essential amino acids \\nat levels that closely match the body’s needs. Studies have \\nshown that these types of protein stimulate muscle growth \\nmore than other types of protein. \\n These foods are also rich in the amino acid leucine, which is \\nan important ‘signalling amino acid’ (see page 105). This amino \\nacid has been shown to be a critical element in regulating \\nprotein manufacture in the body as well as playing a key role in \\nmuscle recovery after exercise. It triggers protein manufacture, \\nwhich in turn leads to increased muscle strength. \\n However, non-animal protein sources, such as beans, \\nlentils, nuts, soya and (to a smaller degree) grains also con -\\ntribute amino acids to your diet and will count towards your \\ntotal daily protein intake (see Table 1.5 on page 19 for the \\nprotein content of various foods).\\nis fat important for building muscle?\\nFat isn’t merely a fuel for training; it also plays a vital role in the manufacture of \\nthe muscle-building hormone testosterone. High testosterone levels stimu late \\nmuscle growth and increase strength. Studies have shown that higher-fat diets \\n(40 per cent calories from fat) can boost testosterone levels (Dorgan et al., 1996). \\nOn the other hand, low-fat diets (less than 20 per cent calories from fat) reduce \\nthe body’s production of testosterone (Hämäläinen et al., 1983). \\n A higher-fat diet may also help to increase levels of insulin-like growth factor \\n(IGF-1), a key hormone that stimulates muscle growth and increases strength. \\n03bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   107 20/12/2013   13:29'),\n",

And low-fat diets are shown to lower IGF-1 levels. In fact, one study found \\nthat when people ate a low-fat diet for 11 days, IGF-1 levels dropped by 20 per \\ncent (Ngo et al., 2002). After two years on a low-fat diet, their IGF-1 levels fell by \\n55 per cent.\\n For optimal muscle building, you should aim to eat about 1.5–2 g fat/kg of \\nbody weight, or about 105–140 g for a 70 kg athlete. That typically equates to \\nabout 30–40 per cent of the total daily calories. This is a moderate amount of fat \\nand is the amount that has been found to keep testosterone levels highest in \\nathletes.\\nWhat should i eat post-workout?\\nMilk and milk-based drinks are near-perfect recovery drinks and good alternatives \\nto many of the commercial protein/carbohydrate recovery drinks. Studies shows \\nthat consuming 500 ml of milk after exercise helps to maintain muscle perfor-\\nmance during the recovery period (Cockburn et al., 2012). Approximately 20 g of \\nprotein is needed to maximise muscle protein synthesis after exercise, therefore \\nyou should consume approximately 600 ml of milk to hit this target. This volume \\nof milk also provides 30 g of carbohydrate, which is necessary to help replenish \\nmuscle glycogen stores and build muscle. \\n Milk also supplies minerals (such as calcium and magnesium) and vitamins, \\nsuch as ribo  flavin. Opt for whole- or semi-skimmed milk or ready-to-drink \\nmilk drinks, or make your own recovery drink from milkshake powder or whey \\npowder. Hot chocolate, latte and other coffee drinks made with milk are also \\nsuitable recovery options. Several studies have shown that con suming milk \\nimmediately after resis  tance exercise increases \\nmuscle growth and repair, reduces post-exercise \\nmuscle soreness, improves body composition \\nand rehydrates the body better than com mercial \\nsports drinks (Elliot et al., 2006; Hartman et al., \\n2007; Wilkinson, 2007; Karp et al., 2006). \\n Recovery continues well past the immediate \\npost-exercise period so you need to continue \\npaying attention to your diet and fluid intake. \\nProtein manufacture increases over the fol-\\nlowing 24–48 hours, generally peaking after \\nabout 24 hours. If you don’t supply your body \\nwith adequate nutrients you risk incomplete \\nrecovery and sub-par adaptation to training. Eat \\n03bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   108 20/12/2013   13:29'),\n",

Instead, increase your calories by focusing on \\nreal food, and getting a balanced intake of fats, protein and ‘quality’ carbohydrate \\nthat won’t put your body into fat-storage mode. Here are nine top tips:\\n1. Put more total eating time into your daily routine. This may mean rescheduling \\nother activities. Plan your meal and snack times in advance and never skip or \\nrush them, no matter how busy you are.\\n2. Increase your meal frequency. Try to eat at least three meals and three (or \\nmore) snacks each day.\\n3. Eat regularly – every 2–3 hours – and avoid gaps longer than three hours.\\n4. Plan nutritious high-calorie snacks – e.g. yoghurt, nuts, dried fruit, flapjacks, \\nand oat-based bars.\\n5. Eat larger meals and increase portion sizes.\\n6. If you are finding it hard to fit in enough food, try nutrient-dense drinks such \\nas whole milk, flavoured milk, milkshakes, and yoghurt and fruit smoothies \\nto help increase your calorie and protein intake. Add ground nuts or seeds to \\nshakes to further boost calories.\\n7. Eat full-fat milk and dairy products, use a little more (olive or coconut) oil for \\ncooking, drizzle olive or walnut oil on salads and vegetables. \\ncheck your body \\ncomposiTion\\nMeasuring your body fat per cent-\\nage using skin-fold callipers or \\nbio  electrical impedance will tell you \\nhow much of you is muscle and how \\nmuch of you is fat (see page 87). In \\ngaining weight, expect some  \\nof that to be fat. If you put on 3 kg  \\nof muscle and 1 kg of fat, you’re \\nmaking great progress. If you gained \\n2 kg of muscle and 2 kg of fat over \\nthe same period, you know your \\nover all calorie and carbohydrate \\nintake is too high, pushing up body \\nfat levels. \\nIf you’re not gaining weight:\\nEat one and a half times the amount \\nof carbohydrate and protein at two \\nof your meals a day. Use extra fats \\n(butter, olive oil or coconut oil) and \\nfollow the rules to the left.\\nIf you’re gaining weight, but it’s as \\nmuch fat as it is muscle:\\nHalve the carbohydrate in your \\nmeals (excluding your post-workout \\nmeal).\\nIf you gained muscle at first, but now \\nyour body fat has increased:\\nHalve your carbohydrate in your \\nlast two meals.

They give you the amounts of foods needed to meet \\nyour calorie and macronutrient requirements. They provide approximately 3,000, \\n3,500 and 4,000 calories and are suitable for individuals weighing less than 65 kg, \\nless than 75 kg and more 75 kg respectively, and doing approximately 1–2 hours \\nmoderate-intensity training a day. If you exercise for longer than an hour a day or \\nat a very high intensity, then you should increase the portion sizes to take account \\nof your greater calorie expenditure. \\n You should use the core menu plans as a template for developing your \\nindividual daily eating plan. Where the menu plan gives a choice of food type \\n(e.g. ‘carbohydrate’), simply pick your preferred option (e.g. pasta or potatoes) or \\nsubstitute an equivalent (high-carbohydrate) food (e.g. quinoa or noodles). Try \\nto vary your choice of fresh fruit and vegetables as much as possible according \\nto what’s in season as this will give you a greater range of micronutrients, \\nantioxidants and phytonutrients. Many of the lower-carbohydrate recipes in Part \\n3 can be incorporated into your plan; simply use the amount of carbohydrate, \\nprotein and fat in the core menu plan as a guide. \\n Measure and weigh your portions carefully to start with to get an idea of what \\ndifferent amounts of foods look like. Thereafter, you should find it quicker and \\neasier to judge how much to eat. You should also track your progress – if you’re not \\ngaining muscle, then you may need to increase your portion sizes overall; if you’re \\ngaining fat as well as muscle, then you may need to reduce the carbohydrate in \\nyour meals. \\n The menu plans do not give quantities for water or other drinks as the amount \\nyou need is quite individual and will vary day to day according to the climate and \\nyour sweat rate. Check your hydration status with the ‘pee test’ (see page 61) and \\nensure you drink sufficient fluids to maintain proper hydration. \\n The menu plans provide guidance on ‘real’ foods, but do not give recom -\\nmendations for sports supplements or products.

Unlike medicines, there’s no \\nsystematic regulation of supplements or herbal remedies, so there’s no \\nguarantee that a supplement lives up to its claims. \\n Many are advertised in fitness publications alongside impres  sive \\ntestimonials or sports celebrity endorsements, which can make the \\nproduct’s claims appear very convincing. But, despite the hype, many \\nsupplements have little, if any, scientific backing. \\n Some types of supplements such as energy bars, gels and drinks \\nrepresent relatively little risk in terms of safety and legality, but another \\ncategory of supplements poses more serious issues: ergogenic aids. \\nErgogenic aids are defined as any external influence created to enhance \\nsport performance. \\nare supplements safe?\\nThe problem with dietary supplements is that they are classified as foods so \\nthey don’t have to undergo safety tests. While some companies do follow good \\nmanufacturing practices, others do not. \\n Supplement manufacturers are not regulated in the same way as medicine \\nmanufacturers, meaning contents listed on the label may not be a true reflection \\nof what they actually contain. There is the risk that such supplements could be \\ncontaminated with banned substances. This is known to be the case as many \\nathletes have been tested positive through the use of such supplements.

Choose reputable manufacturers who can justify their claims with \\nscientific evidence, and have their products screened to minimise the risk of \\ntesting positive for a substance on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s Prohibited \\nList (WADA, 2013). Contact the supplement company to investigate what they do \\nto screen for contamination. \\nHow to evaluate supplements\\nn Don’t be taken in by supplements that promise dramatic results. If the manu-\\nfacturer’s claims sound too good to be true, then they probably are.\\nn Be sceptical of adverts that contain lots of technical jargon or unnecessary \\ngraphs.

There are three types of sports drinks:\\n1. low-calorie (‘lite’) sports drinks\\nWhat’s in them? \\nThese drinks contain sugar, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, mag -\\nnesium, chloride), flavouring, preservatives, colouring and sweeteners. \\nThey are hypotonic, which means they are less concentrated than body \\nfluids, containing between 2 g and 4 g sugar/100 ml. They are absorbed \\nfaster than plain water, but slower than isotonic drinks. \\nDo you need them? \\nThey provide hydration and some fuel (sugar), but not enough to \\nincrease your stamina or performance appreciably compared with \\nwater or flavoured water. The sodium makes them more palatable, \\ndrives your thirst, and helps the body hold on to fluid – but this will \\nnot improve performance or recovery if you’re exercising for less than 2 \\nhours. Choose them for their taste and convenience if you’re exercising \\nat a low intensity for less than an hour. \\n03bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   119 20/12/2013   13:29'),\n",

The sugars in the drink help \\nmaintain blood glucose and spare muscle glycogen. As with low-calorie sports \\ndrinks, the sodium in these drinks improves palatability, increases thirst, and \\nhelps the body hold on to fluid but will not improve your perfor mance unless you \\nare exercising for longer than 2 hours. Drink 400–800 ml/hour, depending on your \\nthirst, sweat rate and surrounding temperature and humidity.\\nMake your own: Add 100 ml cordial or 130 ml squash to a 1-litre water bottle and \\ntop up with water. Alternatively, mix 500 ml apple juice with 500 ml water. If you \\nplan to exercise for more than 2 hours, add 0.5–0.7 g (one eighth of a tsp) of salt.\\n3. dual source sports drinks\\nWhat’s in them? \\nThese contain glucose (or maltodextrin) and fructose in a 2 to 1 ratio, as well \\nas sodium, preservatives, flavouring and colouring. They contain 7–9 g sugar/ \\n100 ml, which makes them isotonic. The dual combination of sugars (glucose and \\nfructose) means that the body can absorb the sugar faster com pared with other \\ndrinks. Studies suggest you can absorb up to 90 g/hour from dual source sports \\ndrinks compared with 60 g/hour from regular drinks.\\nDo you need them? \\nThey may help increase your stamina and performance during high-intensity \\nexer cise lasting more than 3 hours, e.g. triathlon, marathon, ultra-distance events.\\nMake your own: Mix 60 g of glucose (or a mixture of glucose and maltodextrin) \\nand 30 g of fructose in 1 litre of water.

A \\nstudy by researchers at the University of California Davis found that people who \\nconsumed raisins were able to complete a 5-km time trial faster than those who \\nhad only water (Too et al., 2012).\\nEnergy bars\\nWhat’s in them? \\nEnergy bars consist mainly of sugar and maltodextrin; and provide around 250 \\ncalories and 25–35 g of carbohydrate/bar. Some may also have added vitamins \\nand minerals, cereals or soy flour to boost the nutritional content. \\nDo you need them? \\nEnergy bars provide a convenient way of consuming carbohydrate \\nbefore, during or after intense exercise lasting more than one \\nhour. An Australian study compared an energy bar (plus \\nwater) with a sports drink during exercise; it was found \\nthat both boosted blood sugar levels and endurance \\nequally (Mason et al., 1993). \\n In a study at the University of Texas, cyclists were \\ngiven either a sports drink (containing 10 per cent \\ncarbohydrate), an energy bar with water, or a placebo \\n(Yaspelkis et al., 1993). Those who consumed some form \\nof carbohydrate managed to keep going 21 minutes 30 seconds longer before \\nreaching exhaustion than those who only drank flavoured water. The reason? The \\nextra carbohydrate helped fuel the cyclists’ muscles, reducing the dependency \\non glycogen. After 3 hours in the saddle, the cyclists sipping the sports drink or \\neating food had 35 per cent more glycogen than those who had no carbohydrate. \\n The main benefit of energy bars is their convenience: they are easy to carry for \\neating during or after exercise. Make sure to drink water with your bar as this will \\naid digestion and replace fluids lost in sweat. They are an acquired taste and you \\nmay need to experiment with different flavours and brands. \\nReal food alternatives: Bananas, granola bars or fig rolls. An Appalachian Univer -\\nsity study found that bananas were just as effective as sports drinks in increasing \\nperformance in a 75-km cycling time trial (Kennerly et al., 2011). Trained cyclists \\nconsumed 0.2 g carbohydrate/kg of body weight every 15 minutes. On one \\noccasion the carbohydrate were given in the form of a sports drink; on the other \\noccasion they came in the form of bananas. It made no difference where the \\ncarbohydrate came from; the cyclists performed the same.\\n03bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   122 20/12/2013   13:30'),\n",

Nitrate is also found in smaller amounts in other vegetables, such as \\nspinach, rocket, celeriac, cabbage, endive, leeks and broccoli. It is converted to \\nnitrite by ‘friendly’ bacteria in the mouth and then in the stomach to nitric oxide.\\nWhat does it do?\\nBeetroot juice increases the amount of nitric oxide (NO) in your body. This gas has \\nwell-known cardiovascular benefits as it plays an important role in vaso dilation \\nand regulating blood pressure. Increasing NO levels prior to exercise could be an \\nadvantage, as it means blood vessels become more dilated, aiding the delivery of \\noxygen and nutrients to muscles during exercise. \\nWhat is the evidence?\\nA number of studies have shown that nitrate in the form of beetroot juice \\ncan reduce the amount of oxygen needed by exercising muscles to sustain \\n sub-maximal exercise, thereby increasing the muscles’ efficiency and tol er ance of \\nhigh-intensity exercise and increasing endurance. \\n Beetroot increases average power output, exercise efficiency, and length of \\ntime to exhaustion. For example, researchers at the University of Exeter found \\nthat drinking 500 ml of beetroot juice a day for a week enabled vol unteers to run \\n15 per cent longer before experiencing fatigue (Lansley et al., 2011a).

However, it is often considered \\na dietary supplement because it is found in many everyday foods and drinks \\nsuch as coffee, black and green tea, cola, chocolate, energy drinks and gels. It \\nstimulates the central nervous system but provides no actual energy in the form \\nof calories. Caffeine was removed from the banned substance list in January 2004. \\nIt does, however, remain on the monitoring programme and may be added to the \\nprohibited list again if it is found to be misused.\\nWhat does it do?\\nCaffeine acts as a neuromuscular stimulant and changes perceptions of effort \\nor fatigue and improves fibre recruitment. In endurance events, it delays \\nfatigue by reducing the perception of effort. Caffeine does this by increasing \\nthe concentration of hormone-like substances in the brain called ß-endorphins \\nduring exercise. The endorphins affect mood state, reduce the perception of pain, \\nand create a sense of well-being. It may also improve alertness, reaction time and \\nattention span. In shorter events, caffeine increases muscle recruitment, which \\nultimately boosts performance.\\n03bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   125 20/12/2013   13:30'),\n",

This is a \\nlower dose than has been quoted in the past (6–9 mg/kg has \\nbeen used). \\n An analysis by UK researchers of 40 studies on caffeine \\nand performance concluded that it significantly improves \\nendurance, on average by 12 per cent (Doherty and Smith, \\n2004). Another study at the University of Saskatchewan \\nfound that consuming caffeine in amounts equivalent to \\n2\\xa0 mg caffeine/kg of body weight one hour before exercise \\nsig nifi cantly increased bench press muscle endurance \\n(Forbes et al., 2007).\\nDo you need it?\\nTaking 1–3 mg caffeine/kg about one hour before training may boost per for mance. \\nThis equates to a dose of 70–210 mg caffeine (equivalent to approximately 2 cups \\nof coffee) for a 70 kg person. Performance benefits occur soon after consumption, \\nso caffeine may be consumed just before exercise, spread throughout exercise, \\nor late in exercise as fatigue begins to occur. However, the only problem is that \\nthe amount of caffeine in coffee can vary, making it hard to know exactly what \\ndose you are getting.

High doses – \\nabove 300 mg – will have a diuretic effect, and may affect hydration status. \\nSo it is important to keep the intake below this.\\nCreatine\\nWhat is it?\\nCreatine is a protein that is made naturally in the body from three amino \\nacids (arginine, glycine and methionine), but is also found in meat and fish \\nor taken in higher doses as a supplement. As a supplement, creatine is most \\ncommonly taken as creatine monohydrate powder mixed with water, but \\ncapsule forms are also available.\\nWhat does it do?\\nCreatine combines with phosphorus to form phosphocreatine (PC) in muscle \\ncells. This is an energy-rich compound that fuels muscles during high-\\nintensity activities, such as lifting weights or sprinting. Boosting PC levels \\nwith supplements enables you to sustain all-out effort longer than usual and \\nrecover faster between exertions or ‘sets’ , resulting in greater strength and \\nimproved ability to do repeated sets.\\nWhat is the evidence?\\nCreatine monohydrate supplements have \\nbeen well researched over the years and, \\non balance, have proven an effective aid for \\nincreasing strength and muscle mass as well \\nas enhancing performance in high-intensity \\nactivities (Gualano et al., 2012).\\n Studies show significant increases in lean \\nmass and total mass, typically 1–3 per cent \\nlean body weight (approx 0.8–3 kg) after a \\n5-day loading dose, compared with controls \\n– although not all studies show positive \\nresults (Buford et al ., 2007). The observed \\ngains in weight are due partly to an increase \\nin cell fluid volume (i.e. water weight) and \\npartly to muscle synthesis. A review of \\nQ&a\\nQuestion: Does caffeine dehydrate you?\\nanswer: Although caffeine is a diuretic, \\nstudies have shown that regular but \\nmoderate caffeine intake does not  \\ndehydrate the body as was once \\nthought. Only if caffeine is taken in \\nlarge doses – equivalent to more than \\nthree cups of coffee – or infrequently \\nis it likely to have a noticeable diuretic \\neffect. You only need to consume it \\nregularly to build up a tolerance to  \\ncaffeine weakening its diuretic action.\\n03bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   127 20/12/2013   13:30'),\n",

But creatine \\ndoesn’t work for everyone – several studies \\nhave found that creatine made no difference \\nto performance, and it is unlikely to benefit \\nendurance performance.\\n The quickest way of increasing your creatine \\nstores is to use a ‘loading protocol’ of 0.3 g/\\nkg of body weight for 5–7 days. For a 70 kg \\nperson, this translates to 21 g/day. Take this \\namount in four equally divided doses through \\nthe day, e.g. 4 x 5 g. Alternatively, you can ‘load’ \\nwith a smaller dose of 2–3 g/day, but it will take 3–4 weeks to achieve optimal \\nlevels in your muscles. However, there is no advantage in taking more than 20 \\ng/day, nor in loading for more than five days consecutively, as this is the time \\nit usually takes for your muscular stores to reach their maximal capacity. After \\nyour stores are loaded, any extra creatine you ingest will not be absorbed by \\nyour muscles. Following the loading phase your creatine stores can be main-\\ntained by taking 0.03 g/kg of body weight a day for no longer than one month. \\nFor a 70 kg person, that’s 2 g/day. The maintenance amount just needs to replace \\nthe amount of creatine degraded on a daily basis.  As creatine is stored in the \\nmuscle it can be taken at any time of day. However, there is some evidence that it \\nmay be absorbed better when consumed along with carbohydrate immediately  \\nafter training. \\n Creatine monohydrate has been extensively used in studies and appears to  \\nbe the most effective form of creatine. However, the powder form is not very \\nsoluble and produces a chalky liquid when you mix with water. Tablets and \\ncapsules may be a good alternative. Other forms such as citrate, phos phate, \\nmalate (tri-creatine malate) and pyruvate are less effective (Cooper et al., 2012).\\n03bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   128 20/12/2013   13:30'),\n",

This is due partly to extra water in the muscle \\ncells and partly to increased muscle tissue. While this is desirable for bodybuilders \\nand people who work out with weights, it could be disadvantageous in sports \\nwhere there is a critical ratio of body weight to speed (e.g. for runners) or in \\nweight-category sports. Some people suffer from water retention, particularly \\nduring the loading phase. As larger-than-normal amounts of creatine need to be \\nprocessed by the kidneys, there is a theoretical long-term risk of kidney damage, \\nbut this has not been proven. One study found no evidence of impaired kidney \\nfunction after 12 weeks of creatine supplementation (Lugaresi et al., 2013). \\nWhey protein \\nWhat is it?\\nWhey protein is derived from milk (it is the by-product of cheese production) \\nand provides a balanced source of all nine essential amino acids, including the \\nbranched chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine and valine. Leucine is both a \\nkey signal molecule for initiation and an important substrate for new protein \\nsynthesis. Whey is digested quickly and rapidly absorbed in the intestine (vs. \\ncasein which is digested much slower). Whey protein may also help enhance the \\nimmune function thanks to its high content of glutamine. There are three types \\nof whey supplements:\\nn Whey protein concentrate – produced by ultrafiltration of whey, and generally \\ncon tains about 80 per cent protein (the remainder being lactose, fat and water).\\nn Whey protein isolate – produced by a variety of membrane filtration or ion-\\nexchange techniques that remove almost all the lactose and fat, and generally \\ncontains more than 90 per cent protein. \\nn Whey protein hydrolysates – produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of whey con-\\ncentrate or whey isolate, which ‘pre-digests’ the protein by separating peptide \\nbonds; so it is digested and absorbed faster.\\nWhat is the evidence?\\nWhey supplements may help increase muscle synthesis following resistance \\ntraining, but most studies have compared them with carbohydrate, casein or soy \\nsupplements, and not real food. There is no proof that they are superior to real \\nfood sources.\\n In one study, those consuming 20 g of whey supplement before and after \\nresistance exercise had greater increases in muscle mass and muscle strength \\nover 10 weeks compared with those consuming a placebo (Willoughby et al., \\n03bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   129 20/12/2013   13:30'),\n",

Another study found that when athletes consumed a whey supplement \\nimmediately before and after a training session they could perform more reps \\nand lift heavier weights 24 hours and 48 hours after the workout compared with \\nthose taking a placebo (Hoffman et al., 2010).\\n However, consuming any high-quality protein source immedi  ately after \\nresistance training will also promote muscle repair and growth (Tipton et al., \\n2004). Compared with casein or soy, whey supplements may be a better option in \\nthe immediate post-exercise period as whey is absorbed quicker, but there is no \\nevidence that it results in greater muscle growth over 24 hours (Tang et al., 2009). \\n Additionally, whey may also help boost immunity. Researchers found that \\nthose who consumed whey supplements following a 40-km cycling time trial \\nexperienced a smaller drop in glutathione levels, which is linked with lowered \\nimmunity.\\nDo you need them?\\nWhey protein supplements represent an easy and convenient way of adding \\nprotein to your diet if you have higher-than-average requirements. They may be \\nuseful for bodybuilders and strength athletes, as well as vegetarians who do not \\nget enough protein from food sources. Protein supplements are also a convenient \\nway of getting enough protein when you’re out and about. \\n As whey is quickly digested, supplements may be helpful for kick-starting \\nrecovery in those who are training twice a day. Its high leucine content also pro -\\nmotes rapid recovery. However, it won’t necessarily produce faster or greater \\nmuscle gains than real food sources of whey, such as milk, yoghurt and cheese.\\nAre there any side effects?\\nAn excessive intake of protein, whether from food or supplements, is not harmful \\nbut offers no health or performance advantage. Concerns about excess protein \\nharming the liver and kidneys or causing calcium loss from the bones have been \\ndisproved.\\nBeta-alanine \\nWhat is it?\\nBeta-alanine is an amino acid.\\nWhat does it do?\\nBeta-alanine increases muscle levels of a natural substance called carnosine. \\nThese increased levels of muscle carnosine can help offset the build-up of \\nfatiguing lactate during high-intensity exercise, which in turn can enhance sprint \\nand short-distance performance. Normally, a build-up of acidity results in fatigue.\\n03bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   130 20/12/2013   13:30'),\n",

Studies \\nwith long-distance cyclists at the University of Virginia found that supplements \\ntaken before and during a 100-km bike performance test did not improve \\nperformance compared with a carbohydrate drink (Madsen et al., 1996). In other \\nwords, BCAAs may not offer any advantage over carbohydrate drinks taken  \\nduring exercise. \\nDo I need them?\\nA balanced diet with adequate protein should provide enough BCAAs. As long \\nas you’re getting enough dietary macronutrients – such as proteins, fat and \\ncarbohydrate – muscle will be spared.

There’s no RDA in the UK, \\nbut the USA recommend intakes of 15 µg/day (600 IU) and the EU recommend \\n5 µg daily. You can get this amount from 3 eggs or ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) of cod \\nliver oil, or 1 tin (100 g) of sardines or ½ a tin (50 g) of red salmon or 170 g tinned  \\ntuna (in oil).\\nBicarbonate \\nWhat is it?\\nSodium bicarbonate is a pH buffer that may help enhance performance in \\nanaerobic and high-intensity exercise. It is a main ingredient of baking powder.\\nWhat does it do?\\nSupplements (‘bicarbonate loading’) will increase the pH of the blood and make \\nit more alkaline. During high-intensity (anaerobic) exercise, hydrogen ions are \\nproduced, which gradually accumu late and result in fatigue (‘the burn’). However, \\nby raising the pH of the blood, hydro  gen ions can pass more easily from the \\nmuscle cells to the blood, where they can be removed (buffered), which allows \\nyou to continue exercising at a high intensity for a little longer. It also means \\nlactate is removed faster so you can recover more quickly. \\nWhat is the evidence?\\nResearch has shown improvement in high-intensity events lasting 1–7 minutes. \\nOne meta analysis found an improvement of 1.7 per cent for events lasting about \\n1 minute (Carr et al., 2011). \\n03bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   133 20/12/2013   13:30'),\n",

However, there is a high risk of side effects (see below) so you should try it \\nfirst in training. The most common dose for bicarbonate loading is 0.3 g/kg (with \\nat least 500 ml water) 60–90 minutes before the start of exercise (see below). \\nAre there any side effects?\\nBicarbonate may cause gastrointestinal upset, nausea, stomach pain, diarrhoea \\nand vomiting. These side effects could cancel out any performance advantage. \\nSymptoms may be reduced by taking the loading dose in divided doses over a \\n2–2½-hour period before the event, along with a small carbohydrate-rich meal \\nand plenty of water.  \\nGlutamine\\nWhat is it?\\nGlutamine is a non-essential amino acid found abundantly in the muscle cells and \\nblood. Glutamine supplements can be taken as powders, which are mixed with \\nwater or added to a protein shake, and as capsules.\\nWhat does it do?\\nGlutamine is needed for cell growth as well as serving as a fuel for the immune \\nsystem. The glutamine hypothesis is that blood levels of glutamine fall during \\nperiods of heavy training or stress, potentially weakening the immune system \\nand putting you at risk of infection. It has also been suggested that glutamine \\nmay have a protein-sparing effect during intense training. \\nWhat is the evidence?\\nThe evidence for glutamine is divided.

But some \\ncarbohydrate deliver greater nutritional value than others. Make \\nmost of your carbo  hydrate whole grains, fruits and vegetables. And \\nremember: the less processing a plant receives, the more nutritious  \\nit is (think potatoes, not potato crisps).\\n The two main causes of fatigue during endurance exercise are \\ndepletion of carbo  hydrate stores and dehydration. Filling your \\nglycogen stores before training will delay the onset of fatigue. As a \\nbonus, the run will seem easier to complete when you have enough \\nglycogen on board. Eating a daily diet containing 5–7 g carbohydrate/\\nkg of body weight (that’s 350–490 g for a 70 kg runner) will speed your \\nrecovery from daily runs. \\n It’s important to begin a run properly hydrated if you want to put in a good \\nperformance. Aim to drink 5–7 ml of fluid/kg of body weight about 4 hours \\nbefore exercise – equivalent to 350–490 ml for a 70 kg person. That way, you’ll \\nhave enough time for your body to excrete what you don’t need before you  \\nbegin exercising.  \\nShort runs (<60 minutes)\\nDuring short\\xadduration, moderate\\xadintensity runs extra carbohydrate is not neces\\xad\\nsary. Provided you’ve consumed enough carbohydrate during the previous \\n24 hours, then your muscles should have stored enough glycogen to fuel your \\ntraining run. If you’re running for less than an hour, you won’t deplete glycogen \\ncompletely so there’s no need to consume anything other than water during  \\nyour run. \\n There are no hard and fast rules about how much to drink but, for most \\nconditions, 400–800 ml/hour will prevent dehydration as well as overhydration. \\nYou should listen to your body and drink when you are thirsty. \\nLong runs (>60 minutes)\\nIf you’re running for longer than an hour, carbohydrate becomes an important \\npart of your nutrition strategy as there’s a higher risk of depleting your glycogen \\nstores. This can result in early fatigue and slower performance. Consuming \\ncarbohydrate either in the form of a drink or as food provides your muscles with \\na ready supply of blood glucose for immediate energy, which spares glycogen \\nstores and helps you to run longer. This should help delay fatigue and increase \\nyour endurance. \\nQ&a\\nWill I use more calories over a given \\ndistance if I run fast or slowly?\\nIf you were to cover, say, 5 miles \\nin 30 minutes, you would burn \\nthe same calories as you would \\njogging the same distance in 45 \\nminutes. In fact, the calorie burn \\nwould be the same even if you \\nwalked the distance.\\nThe difference comes once \\nyou have stopped. Your metabolic \\nrate will stay higher for longer \\nafter intense exer cise, whereas \\nthe metabolic boost will be far \\nlower after moderate activity. This \\nmeans that you burn more calories \\nafter you have finished a fast run \\nthan after a slow run.\\n04bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   142 20/12/2013   13:50'),\n",

If you over \\xadconsume carbohydrate, it will stay in \\nyour stomach longer and cause discomfort. If you under \\xadconsume carbo\\xad\\nhydrate, it may compromise your performance. For maximum performance, \\naim to consume 30–60 g carbohydrate/hour, depending on how hard you are \\nexercising. That’s equivalent to 400–800 ml of a 6 per cent drink (6 g sugar/100 \\nml), such as cordial or squash diluted 1 to 6, or an isotonic sports drink (see \\npage 67).\\n Extra sodium in the form of sports drinks is not necessary for runs lasting \\nless than 2 hours as it does not speed fluid delivery during exercise. It simply \\npromotes thirst (and therefore makes you drink more) and makes the body \\nhold on to more water.\\n Alternatively, you can get your carbohydrate in the form of gels, energy \\nbars, bananas, granola bars or dried fruit (see page 122). Two gels/hour delivers \\n50 g of carbohydrate. Experimenting with different foods and products in \\ntraining is important as individual responses can vary. \\n Drink according to your thirst and your body’s sweat rate. You’ll sweat \\nmore in hot and humid conditions and when working out harder/faster. It’s \\nbetter to drink little and often – say, 100–150 ml every 15 minutes, as this will \\nresult in greater retention and less urination. \\nAfter a run\\nThe sooner you start to replace the fluid, the sooner you will recover. This \\nis why you should make drinking your priority immediately after a run. The \\nexact amount you need to drink depends on how dehydrated you are after \\nexercising. To get an idea of how much fluid you have lost through sweat, \\nweigh yourself before and after exercise. For each 0.5 kg (1 lb approx) of body \\nweight lost, drink 600–750 ml of fluid, but not all in one go.\\n Both water and sodium need to be replaced to restore normal fluid balance \\nafter exercise. This can be achieved either by consuming a sports drink (which \\ncontains sodium) or water with food (that naturally contains sodium) if there \\nis no urgency for recovery. \\n Replacing your glycogen stores after a run is crucial if you want to run \\nwell the next day. If you plan to run again within 24 hours, get into the habit \\nof having a drink or snack containing carbohydrate and some protein, ideally \\nin a ratio of 3 to 1, after a run. Consuming carbohydrate and protein within \\n2 hours of running speeds glycogen recovery and muscle repair. Suitable \\noptions include flavoured milk, fruit with yoghurt, a commercial recovery \\ndrink, or a flapjack with milk (see Table 7.2).  \\nQ&a\\nI often get cramps in my calves during a \\nrun. Is there anything I can eat or drink to \\nstop this happening?\\nThere is no single explan ation for \\nmuscle cramps – research suggests that \\nsome people are more susceptible than \\nothers (see page 67). They are most \\nlikely due to altered neuromuscular \\ncontrol, which can occur if you set off \\ntoo fast in a training run or race or if \\nyou have muscular imbalances. There’s \\nlittle evidence that they are caused by \\ndehydration or lack of sodium. If you \\nget cramp during a run, slow down, \\nstretch and try to relax the affected \\nmuscle(s).  \\n04bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   143 20/12/2013   13:50'),\n",

For \\nexample, if your race starts at 9 a.m., have breakfast at 5–6 a.m. Consume 25–\\n50 g of carbohydrate for each hour before the start of the race, depending \\non your body weight and the race duration. Carbohydrate\\xadrich foods, such as \\nporridge, cereal, toast and fruit, are good choices. Include a little protein or \\nhealthy fat to reduce the glycaemic response and give a slow, steady energy \\nrelease. If you can’t eat because of pre\\xadrace nerves, have an extra bedtime \\nsnack the night before or try a liquid meal (e.g. an all\\xadin\\xadone shake, milkshake, \\nsmoothie or yoghurt drink) for breakfast, which will empty from your stomach \\nfaster than solid food.\\n Drink 350–500 ml of water or diluted fruit juice (1 part juice to 1–2 parts \\nwater) 2–4 hours before the race, then another 125–250 ml during the warm\\xadup \\nor just before you get to the starting line. If you decide to take caffeine, whether \\nin the form of a drink or gel, consume this about 30–60 minutes before the race  \\nstart time. \\nQ&a\\nDespite doing a lot of running, I have \\ncellulite. Is it different from ordinary \\nfat and is there a special diet I could \\nfollow to help get rid of it?\\nCellulite is simply fat. The reason \\nit appears dimpled and puckered \\nis that it lies very close to the skin’s \\nsurface and is criss-crossed by weak \\ncollagen strands that aren’t very \\neffective at supporting fat cells. \\nThis results in the characteristic \\nbulging appearance of cellulite. The \\nreason women get cellulite far more \\nthan men is the female hormone \\noestrogen, which favours fat \\nstorage on the thighs and bottom; \\nhence women tend to put weight \\non in these areas. Inactivity, loss of \\nmuscle tone and excess calories are \\nmajor contributors to the formation \\nof cellulite. A healthy but careful \\ncalorie consumption combined with \\ncardiovascular and resistance  \\nexercise is the only proven way to \\nbeat cellulite. There is no evidence \\nthat it is caused by ‘toxins’ or that \\nfollowing a detox diet reduces  \\ncellulite. However, cutting back  \\non processed foods or those high  \\nin sugar, salt and fat will help \\nreduce fat. \\n04bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   147 20/12/2013   13:50'),\n",

However, your nutrition strategy isn’t \\nover yet; you still have to replenish your fluid losses and depleted glycogen stores. \\nThis is especially important if you plan to train the next day. \\n Start with water or, if you have been running for longer than 60 minutes, a \\nsports drink. You need to replace the fluid you have lost but you won’t know \\nexactly how much without a set of scales. For every 0.5 kg of body weight lost \\nyou need to drink 750 ml of fluid. Try to drink around 500 ml, little and often, in \\nthe first 30 minutes after the race, and then keep sipping every 5 to 10 minutes \\nuntil you are passing pale\\xadcoloured urine again. You should be able to pass urine \\nwithin 2 hours of a race. If you pass only a small volume of dark \\xadyellow urine, or \\nif you have a headache and feel nauseous, then you need to keep drinking. If \\nyou are dehydrated, sports drinks or diluted cordial/fruit juice with a pinch of salt \\nadded are the best options.\\n Have a snack containing carbohydrate and protein – ideally in a 3 to 1 ratio \\n– within the first 30 minutes of the end of the race (when blood flow to your \\nmuscles is greater and the muscles are more receptive to carbohydrate).

Each plan gives you the amounts of foods needed \\nto meet your calorie and macronutrient requirements, providing approximately \\n3,000 and 2,500 calories.

Try to vary your choice of fresh \\nQ&a\\nI sometimes suffer from ‘the trots’ on long runs. What causes it and how can I  \\nprevent it?\\nThe ‘trots’ or ‘runs’ is common among endurance runners. Studies have shown that \\nas many as one in four marathon runners experience it. The most likely explanation \\nis that the lower gut (colon) becomes starved of oxygen during a long run due to \\na reduced blood flow. Blood is diverted away from the gut to the muscles and the \\nskin, where more blood is required. This can result in spasmodic contractions of the \\ncolon. Being dehydrated will make the situation worse as the reduced blood volume \\nmeans that even less blood is available to the gut.\\nThe best strategy to prevent diarrhoea is to drink plenty of water before and  \\nduring a run. Make sure that you drink during the early stages. It is also a good idea \\nto avoid eating high-fibre foods, especially bran and wholegrain cereals, pulses \\nand dried fruit, too close to the time of your run. These may loosen the stools and \\ntrigger bowel movements, a situation made worse by pre-race nerves. Caffeine and \\nsorbitol sometimes have a laxative effect so you may also wish to avoid drinks and \\nfoods containing them. Keeping a food and training diary can help you work out \\nwhich foods you can tolerate and which you need to avoid before a run. \\n04bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   150 20/12/2013   13:50'),\n",

If you train for  \\n1–2 hours a day you will need to eat between 5 and 7 g/kg of body weight each \\nday (that’s 300–420 g in a 60 kg swimmer). However if you spend more than  \\n2 hours a day training (whether it’s in the pool or doing other activities), you \\nwill need more like 7–10 g of carbohydrate/kg of body weight per day (that’s  \\n420–600\\xa0g for a 60 kg swimmer). If you swim for less than an hour, you’ll need \\nless carbohydrate to fuel your muscles: approximately 3–5 g/kg of body weight, \\nwhich equates to 180–300\\xa0g/day for a 60 kg person. \\n For all swimmers, a general guideline is to have one \\xadthird of your plate as \\nnutrient\\xaddense (‘quality’) carbohydrate\\xadrich foods (e.g. potatoes, sweet potatoes, \\nwholegrain bread, pasta or rice); one \\xadthird protein (meat, fish, chicken, eggs, \\ncheese, beans, lentils) and one\\xadthird vegetables (or salad). You should also include \\nhealthy fats (butter, olive oil, oily fish, nuts) in your meals and snacks, and at least \\n400 g (5 portions) of fruit and veg a day to ensure you get the omega\\xad3 fats, \\nvitamins, minerals, fibre and other protective nutrients needed to stay healthy \\nand promote recovery. \\nBefore swimming\\nThe optimal time for your pre \\xadexercise meal is 2–4 hours before training. If your \\ntraining session starts at 7 p.m., have dinner at 4 or 5 p.m. Aim for ‘comfortably \\nfull’ , not stuffed. If there isn’t time for a meal, then have a smaller meal or healthy \\nsnack 30 minutes or 1 hour before training, with a drink. \\n Of all the foods you could have before a workout, prioritise ones rich in \\ncarbohydrate (plus protein), especially if you will be training for 2 hours or longer. \\nCombining carbohydrate with protein produces a low to moderate glycaemic \\nresponse (gradual rise blood glucose), which will provide sustained energy and \\nmaximum performance.  \\nBefore early morning swim training\\nIf you train early in the morning, prioritise drinking first thing to ensure you \\narrive at the pool properly hydrated. Drink around 200–300 ml water to replace \\nfluid lost in sweat during the night. If you plan to swim for longer than an hour, \\neat a mini\\xadbreakfast 30–60 minutes before training – you should never train on \\nempty! Training on empty may result in early fatigue, low blood glucose levels, \\nlightheadedness, nausea and a poor performance. Consume nutritious high\\xad\\ncarbo hydrate foods, such as wholegrain toast with honey, porridge, dried fruit or \\na banana. If a meal is out of the question, have a nutritious drink, such as milk, a \\nPre-Training meal ideas\\nn Jacket potato with cheese, tuna \\nor beans plus veg\\nn Pasta with meat, cheese, tuna \\nor chicken plus veg \\nn Rice with chicken, fish or beans \\nplus veg\\nn One-pot dish with meat or fish \\nor beans; potatoes or pasta  \\nand veg\\nn Toast (wholegrain) with honey \\nor jam \\nn A banana (or other fresh fruit) \\nn A handful of dried fruit (e.g. \\nraisins, apricots) \\nn Porridge or wholegrain \\nbreakfast cereal with milk\\nn Milk or an all-in-one protein/\\ncarbo hydrate shake\\n04bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   156 20/12/2013   13:50'),\n",

Some fuel \\nis better than no fuel at all. \\nDuring swimming\\nIt’s hard to imagine that with so much water around, you could still get \\ndehydrated. But you will still lose some fluid through sweating while swimming \\n– it’s just that it goes straight into the surrounding water. Fluid losses are likely \\nto be smaller than for land\\xadbased activities, so be guided by thirst. The easiest \\nway of preventing dehydration in swimming is by starting your session properly \\nhydrated. If you begin training in a dehydrated state, then you won’t be able to \\nrehydrate or ‘catch\\xadup’ during your session no matter how much you try to drink \\n– your performance will suffer and you will tire quickly. \\n If you plan to swim for longer than 30 minutes, keep a water bottle on the \\npoolside, and try to have a few swigs every 20 or so laps (according to your thirst), \\nrather than a large volume in one go. For hard (elite) swimming, the general rule \\nis to drink about 125 ml of fluid for every kilometre swum. \\n If you swim for longer than an hour, opt for a drink containing 4–8 g carbo\\xad\\nhydrate/100 ml, such as cordial or squash diluted 1 to 6 or an isotonic sports drink \\n(see page 67). The extra fuel will top up blood glucose, spare glycogen in your \\nmuscles, make swimming feel easier and help you keep going longer. But you’ll \\nneed to start drinking within the first 30 minutes as it takes around 30 minutes \\nfor those carbohydrate to reach your muscles.

Practise your competition \\xadday eating \\nstrategy in training – maybe have a simulated competition – prior to putting it  \\nin place.\\nThe week before\\nCarbohydrate loading, practised by endurance athletes to increase their muscle \\nglycogen levels above normal, is not relevant for most swimming competitions. \\nUnless you plan to swim for more than 2 hours continuously, you are not likely to \\nrun out of glycogen. However, ensuring that you have ‘normal’ levels of glycogen \\nin your muscles will help you swim faster and recover better between heats.  \\n If you compete frequently, then you will probably ‘swim through’ the minor \\nmeets and only taper for major competitions. For these, you should reduce \\nthe volume of your training over a period of between a few days and two \\nweeks, depending on your age and experience. In practice this usually means \\nmaintaining the frequency but reducing the distance and number of sets per \\nsession, together with a reduction in the amount of land\\xadbased training you do. \\nAs your training volume drops, you should also adjust your food (calorie) intake to \\nmatch your energy expenditure otherwise you may end up with unwanted last\\xad\\nminute weight gain. Doing only very light training or resting completely for the \\nlast day or two will allow the carbohydrate you eat to be stored as glycogen and \\nnot to be burned during a workout. \\n Eating a balanced diet is really all you need to do during the last week. \\nProvided that you ease back on your training, you will allow your muscles to fill \\nout with glycogen. Focus on the nutritional quality (nutrient\\xaddensity) of your diet \\nby minimising sugar and refined carbohydrate.\\nThe day before\\nKeep exercise to a minimum and plan your meals and snacks carefully, especially \\nif you will be travelling to the venue the day before. You need to top up those \\nmuscle glycogen stores and keep properly hydrated. If travelling, it is a good idea \\nto contact the hotel or venue beforehand to find out what kind of food will be \\navailable. If necessary, take your own food.\\n Have small meals every 2–4 hours to keep your blood sugar levels steady \\nand fuel your muscles in preparation for the next day’s event. Avoid big meals \\nor over\\xadeating during the evening, as this will almost certainly make you feel \\nuncomfortable and lethargic the next day. If you feel nervous you probably won’t \\nhave much of an appetite. Try liquid meals such as all\\xadin\\xadone shakes, milkshakes, \\nmilk or smoothies.

Also try to adjust portion sizes according to \\nyour appetite and how energetic you feel during training. \\nIf you feel hungrier than usual, that’s your body’s way of \\nsignalling its needs so you should eat more food. Similarly, \\nif you fatigue early in training or find it harder to recover \\nbetween training ses sions, then you should also increase \\nyour portion sizes.

Knowing exactly what and how much to eat and \\ndrink is an important part of your day-to-day training programme, but \\nis particularly important when it comes to preparing for a cycling event. \\nThis chapter will help you put the information in Chapters 1–6 into \\npractice and give you a template for constructing a daily eating plan. It \\nalso provides you with a pre-race nutrition strategy and a fuelling and \\nhydration race-day template to help you put in a winning performance – \\nor at least make it to the finish without bonking (running out of energy, \\nlike ‘hitting the wall’ in running)! \\n \\nHow many calories?\\nCycling demands a lot of energy from your body. The number of calories you burn \\ncycling depends on your speed, the terrain, your weight, and how long you are in \\nthe saddle. For example, cycling at a leisurely pace (11.3 km/hour or 7 mph) burns \\n298 calories/hour if you weigh 70 kg, while racing (25.8 km/hour or 16 mph) burns \\naround 710 calories/hour. Table 9.1 shows you approximately how many calories \\nyou burn per hour at various speeds. \\nTable 9.1 Calories used in CyCling\\nspeed cals/kg/hour 60 kg 65 kg 70 kg 75 kg 80 kg\\nLeisure (11.3 km/hour or 7 mph) 4.26 256 277 298 320 341\\nHard (16.1 km/hour or 10 mph) 6.42 385 417 449 482 514\\nRacing (25.8 km/hour or 16 mph) 10.14 608 659 710 761 811\\n Your daily calorie needs also depend on your weight, as well as your muscle \\nmass, daily activity level and training frequency.

Carbo  hydrate is turned \\ninto glycogen in your muscles, which then fuels your training. When your muscle \\nglycogen stores are high, your training rides will feel easier – you’ll be able to keep \\ngoing longer and faster before getting tired. If you cycle for less than 2 hours per \\nday, you’ll probably need to eat 5–7 g of carbohydrate/kg of body weight per day \\n(that’s 350–490 g for a 70 kg cyclist). If you cycle up to 3–4 hours daily, you’ll need \\nmore like 7–10 g of carbohydrate/kg of body weight per day (that’s 490–700 g for \\na 70 kg cyclist). \\n A lot of endurance cyclists get carried away with carbohydrate and forget \\nabout protein and fat. While carbohydrate is important for fuelling your muscles, \\nyou also need protein to repair muscle fibres broken down during long hard rides. \\nIf you skimp on protein, you may lose muscle. During hard training, some protein \\n– as well as carbohydrate and fat – is used as fuel and can make up as much as \\n15 per cent of the calorie mix. You need 1.2–1.4 g/kg body weight daily – that’s \\n84–98 \\xa0g if you weigh 70 kg. So include a portion (about the size of your fist) of \\nprotein with each meal – chicken, fish, lean meat, cottage cheese, tofu or QuornTM. \\n Eat at least five portions of fresh fruit and vegetables each day. They provide \\nantioxidants, which not only boost your immunity but also may help counteract \\nsome of the harmful effects of pollutants you breathe in during road rides. \\nPollutants from traffic fumes and smog increase the number of free radicals (see \\npage 29) that your body has to deal with. By stepping up your intake of antioxidant-\\nrich foods, you’ll bolster your body’s natural defences against these free radicals. \\nChoose a wide variety of fruit and vegetables – the more intensely coloured, the \\nhigher the antioxidant potential. Blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, spinach, \\nred peppers and Brussels sprouts are richest in antioxidants. \\nShorter rides (<60 minutes) \\nIf you’re cycling for less than an hour, water is all you need to maintain hydration \\nand performance. Extra carbohydrate in the form of sports drinks, gels or bars is \\nnot necessary. You should have sufficient glycogen in your muscles to fuel your \\nride. Ensure that you are properly hydrated before you set off by drinking 5–7\\xa0ml \\nof fluid/kg of body weight about 4 hours before exercise (350–490 ml for a 70\\xa0kg \\nperson). There are no hard and fast rules about how much to drink during a ride, \\nbut for most conditions 400–800 ml/hour will prevent dehydration as well as \\noverhydration. You should listen to your body and drink when you are thirsty. \\n Wind chill and rapid evaporation of sweat can give you the false sense that \\nyou’re not losing much fluid. Even if you don’t feel hot or sweaty, you could be \\nlosing fluid so you still need to drink.\\nQ&a\\nWill cola help me keep going for \\nlonger?\\nA lot of cyclists prefer drinking flat \\ncola during long hard workouts \\nand races. Much of the claimed \\nbenefits are based on hearsay \\nhanded down from one competitor \\nto another (see page 71). The truth \\nis that cola possesses no special \\nperformance-enhancing quality – it \\nis simply a sugary drink, con taining \\naround 11 g sugar/100 ml. It can \\ngive you a quick energy boost, \\nbut won’t hydrate you very fast \\nas it is too concentrated to empty \\nfrom the stomach quickly. You’ll \\nget a similar sugar ‘hit’ from sports \\ndrinks, bananas, energy gels or \\nsolid food. Much of the appeal of \\ncola is probably its caffeine content \\n(32–42 mg/330 ml can of regular \\nor diet cola). But you would need \\naround 200 mg of caffeine to get a \\nperformance-enhancing effect. \\n05bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   170 20/12/2013   14:15'),\n",

Take a supply of cordial \\nor sports drinks and/or carbohydrate-rich snacks (such as dried fruit, \\nflapjacks, energy bars, gels, bananas or granola bars) with you. You’ll \\nneed to begin fuelling within the first 30 minutes as it takes a further \\n30 minutes for those carbohydrate to reach your active muscles. If \\nyou eat solid food, drink water rather than sports drinks. Studies have \\nshown that consuming extra carbohydrate on rides lasting longer \\nthan 90 minutes increases endurance and performance during a race. \\nAim to consume around 30–60 g/carbohydrate per hour; that’s 120–\\n240 calories – equivalent to 400–800 ml/hour of a 6 per cent sugar \\ndrink, such as cordial/squash diluted 1 in 6 or an isotonic sports drink \\n(depending on the heat, humidity and your intensity). \\n Be warned that some brands can ‘sit heavy’ in the stomach during \\nhard rides – you may find them easier to tolerate diluted with extra \\nwater. You’ll need to experiment to find the drink strength that suits \\nyou best. Try making up powdered drinks with extra water if necessary \\nor take a bottle of sports drink and a bottle of water, alternately drinking \\nboth. \\n You have the advantage over other endurance athletes in that you \\ncan carry fluids and food on the bike frame or in jersey pockets. Also, it’s \\neasier to eat solid foods, as you’re not bouncing around. Learning to eat \\nduring cycling without swerving can be tricky at first. \\nafter cycling\\nIf you plan to exercise within 24 hours, start refuelling within 30 \\nminutes of a ride. There exists a 2-hour window when glycogen is \\nrestocked about one and a half times faster than normal. The sooner \\nyou can get carbohydrate to your muscles, the faster you will be able \\nto recover. If you have a high-carbo hydrate snack, ideally with a little \\nprotein (in a ratio of about 1 g protein/3 g carbohydrate), as soon as \\nyou have showered, you will be able to cycle better the next day and \\nfeel generally more energetic. If you leave a longer gap before eating, \\nit will take you longer to recover and your legs won’t feel as fresh the \\nnext day. Suitable options include flavoured milk, fruit with yoghurt, a \\ncommercial recovery drink or a flapjack with milk.  \\nHow To eaT and drink in THe \\nsaddle\\nn On long rides, wearing specially designed \\npacks that contains a plastic bladder \\n(such as a camel pack) allows you to drink \\nwithout having to take your hands off the \\nhandlebars. You can carry larger volumes \\nof drink without needing to stop off to  \\nrefill your bottle.\\nn In hot weather, add ice cubes to your drink \\nor freeze half the bottle (or camel pack) \\novernight and top it up before you get on \\nyour bike. \\nn Stash small snacks in the pockets of your \\njersey. \\nn Open your bars and undo packets before \\nyou set off so the food is easy to get at with \\none hand during your ride. \\nn Peel fruit and wrap in foil for easy access.\\nn Wrap dried fruit and biscuits in foil or small \\nresealable plastic bags.\\nn Soft-textured bars may be wrapped around \\nyour handle bars for easy access.\\nn Practise riding without holding on to the \\nhandle bar so that you can balance more \\neasily while you eat and drink.\\n05bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   171 20/12/2013   14:15'),\n",

For example, an extra 4 hours in the saddle each \\nweek burns around 1,800 extra calories if you weigh 70 kg (see page 4 for an idea \\nof how many extra calories you are burning). If you don’t make any adjustment \\nto your overall calorie intake, you risk losing muscle (and fat). If you can do with \\nshedding some body fat, the extra training will help, but make sure you step up \\nyour protein intake to 1.6–2.0 g/kg (112–140 g for a 70 kg cyclist) to preserve \\nmuscle mass (see page 169). \\n If you don’t already, you’ll need to practise drinking from a water bottle or \\neating snacks while riding. Work out how to keep your balance without swerving \\nwhile you drink, or eat with one hand.

Whatever you plan to do during \\nthe race, rehearse it before. Practise drinking from a water bottle, or if \\nyou plan to use a camel pack in the event, use it during your training \\nrides. Experiment with different foods – gels, bars and bananas – to \\nfind the types and amounts that suit you best. Research the foods \\nand drinks to be provided at the stations so you can test them out \\nbeforehand. Alternatively, take your own supplies. \\nThe week before\\nWhat you eat and drink during the week before your long ride or \\nrace can make a big difference to your performance. You goals are \\nto maximise your muscle glycogen stores and keep yourself well \\nhydrated. \\n10- and 25-mile time trials\\nIf you’ll be racing for less than about 60 minutes, what you eat and \\ndrink before is more important than what you consume during the \\nrace. Make sure you keep hydrated – your urine should be a pale straw \\ncolour – and that you keep eating your normal diet. Your muscles will \\nbe able to store enough glycogen since you’ll also be reducing your \\ntraining load. You won’t deplete glycogen completely so there’s no \\nneed to ‘carb-load’ . Make sure you avoid high-intensity training the \\nday or two before so that you don’t deplete your muscle glycogen. \\nLong races\\nIf you’ll be racing for more than an hour, you’ll need to ensure that your \\nmuscles are fully rested and stocked with glycogen before the event. \\nTaper your training gradually. For the last few days of the week you \\nshould be cutting the time spent in the saddle by half and then resting \\ncompletely for the last day or two. If you don’t reduce your training \\nyou risk using the carbo hydrate you’re eating to fuel your training rides \\ninstead of stockpiling it for the big event. \\n Eat your normal diet until three days before racing, and then increase your \\ncarbohydrate intake (7–10 g carbo  hydrate/kg of body weight) for the final three \\ndays, plus on race morning. Tipping the balance of calories a little more in favour \\nof carbohydrate (roughly 60–70 per cent carbo hydrate calories) and eating \\ncorrespondingly less fat should boost your glycogen levels and give you more \\nfuel for the event. Tapering your training along with increasing your carbohydrate \\nintake can increase your endurance by as much as 20 per cent. \\n05bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   173 20/12/2013   14:15'),\n",

It’s also important to keep yourself hydrated and avoid eating or drinking \\nanything that may jeopardise your performance. \\n Don’t try any new foods. The last thing you want before a race is a stomach \\nupset, so play it safe by sticking to familiar foods. Choose fairly plain foods, such \\nas fish with rice or potatoes with chicken, and avoid spicy and salty foods such as \\ncrisps, takeaways, ready-made sauces and ready-meals.   \\n Eating small frequent meals will maximise glycogen storage without \\nmaking you feel bloated and heavy. Drink plenty of fluids throughout \\nthe day to ensure you are properly hydrated. Your urine should be pale \\nstraw coloured. \\n Steer clear of high-fibre gas-forming foods, such as baked beans, \\nlentils and other pulses, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, bran cereals and \\nspicy foods. Eating them could give you an uncomfortable ride the next \\nday!\\n Do not overindulge the evening before your race. A large meal – \\neven if it’s high in carbohydrate – could make you feel sluggish the next \\nday. Alcohol is a diuretic so it’s better to avoid it completely otherwise \\nyou risk dehydration and a hangover on race day. \\nrace day nutition\\nOn the day of the race, your muscle glycogen levels should be fully stocked and \\nyou should be feeling rested. If the event is in the morning, you’ll need to get up \\nabout 4 hours before and have your pre-race meal. This should be rich in carbo-\\nhydrate to top up the store of glycogen in your liver and keep up your blood \\nsugar levels for the next few hours. Aim for 150–200 g of carbohydrate before a \\nlong race; for short rides under an hour, you may need only 75–150 g. If you find \\nit difficult to eat solid food when you’re feeling nervous, try a liquid meal instead \\n(see page 147). Skipping that pre-race meal may leave you low in energy during \\nthe final stages.\\n Steer clear of bran and high-fibre cereals, especially if you are feeling nervous. \\nCereal fibre may loosen the stools and cause more bowel move  ments than \\nnormal. Select foods that are fairly low in fibre, such as white toast instead of \\nbrown, cornflakes instead of bran flakes. \\n Make sure that you are properly hydrated by drinking 350–500 ml of water, \\ncordial, squash, a sports drink or diluted fruit juice (1 part juice to 1 or 2 parts \\nwater) about 2–4 hours before the race.

It’s also wise to top up with a further 125–250 ml in the  \\nwarm-up or just before you head to the line. If you decide to take caffeine, \\nwhether in the form of a drink or gel, consume this about 30–60 minutes \\nbefore the race start time. The sodium naturally present in your food will \\nalso help the body hold on to fluid (which may be advantageous prior to \\na race when it’s important to avoid dehydration) so, despite the marketing \\nhype, there’s no need to consume a sports drink – i.e. a drink with sodium or \\nelectrolytes – beforehand. \\n Drink whatever you used in training. As a rule of thumb, water (or low-\\ncalorie sports drinks if you prefer the taste) is fine for 10- or 25-mile races or \\nrides lasting less than 60–90 minutes; isotonic sports drinks, squash or cordial \\nare better for longer races. But do not try anything different – even if it’s freely \\nprovided by the organisers – in case it doesn’t agree with you under race \\nconditions. \\n In hot conditions, start drinking early, ideally in the first 20–30 minutes. \\nIf you pick your moment, like a steady climb, it’s not much of a disruption to \\nyour rhythm. Take three or four swigs, and then according to thirst. Remember \\nthat wind chill and rapid evaporation of sweat can mask feelings  of thirst. \\n For rides longer than 60 minutes you will need food or a sports drink to \\nkeep up your blood sugar levels. Try to consume 400–800 ml/hour. Or try  \\ngels, energy bars, granola bars, fig rolls or a banana with plenty of water. Eat \\nlittle and often to save your digestive system having to work too hard. \\n It’s easier to eat and drink when you’re riding on the flat and in a straight \\nline; climbing, descending and cornering demand your full concentration. \\nTake advantage of the food served at the rest stops but don’t eat anything \\nyou haven’t used in training. \\nAfter the race\\nIt’s a great sense of accomplishment when you have completed the race and \\ncross the finishing line. Before you load up your bike and start back home, \\nthough, start rehydrating and refuelling your body. Recovery needs to begin \\nnow to set you up for the next week’s training and the next race.\\n Drink plenty of liquids to replace fluid losses. As a guide, have 500 ml as \\nsoon as practical, ideally within the first 30 minutes, then keep drinking small \\nregular amounts until your urine is pale in colour. If you are dehydrated, a \\nsports drink or diluted juice with a pinch of added salt will deliver fluid \\nfaster and the sodium they contain helps your body retain the fluid better. \\nAlternatively, opt for a recovery drink containing carbohydrate and protein in \\na 3 to 1 ratio for speedy fuel and muscle recovery. \\nQ&a\\nHow can I avoid the ‘bonk’?\\nThe ‘bonk’ is a common problem. It \\nhappens when you have used up the \\nglycogen in your muscles and liver and \\nhave no energy left. To avoid this, drink \\nsports drinks or eat high-carbo hydrate \\nsnacks regularly during the ride. Try \\nenergy bars, bananas, energy gels, and \\ngranola or energy bars. Aim to consume \\n30–60 g carbohydrate/hour – that’s one \\nor two bars (depending on the size) or a \\n couple of gel sachets, or 2–4 bananas or \\n400–800 ml of an isotonic sports drink \\n(depending on the strength).\\n05bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   175 20/12/2013   14:15'),\n",

Pick the plan that most closely \\nmatches your training schedule (up to 2 hours, or more than \\n2 hours a day) and energy requirement. However, if you train \\nlonger, then you should increase the portion sizes to take \\naccount of your greater calorie expenditure. \\n Where the menu plan gives a choice of food type (e.g. \\ncarbohydrate), simply pick your preferred option (e.g. pasta \\nor potatoes) or substitute an equivalent (high-carbohydrate) \\nfood (e.g. quinoa or noodles). Try to vary your choice of \\nfresh fruit and vegetables as much as possible according \\nto what’s in season as this will give you a greater range of \\nmicronutrients, antioxidants and phytonutrients. Many of \\nthe lower-carbohydrate recipes in Part 3 can be incorporated \\ninto your plan; simply use the amount of carbohydrate, \\nprotein and fat in the core menu plan as a guide. \\n Measure and weigh your portions carefully to start with \\nto get an idea of what different amounts of foods look like. \\nThereafter, you should find it quicker and easier to judge how \\nmuch to eat. \\n You should also adjust portion sizes according to your \\nappetite and how energetic you feel during training. If you \\nfeel hungrier than usual, that’s your body’s way of signalling \\nits needs, so you should eat more food. Similarly, if you \\nfatigue early in training or find it harder to recover between \\ntraining sessions, then you should also increase your portion \\nsizes. Keep a check on your weight and body composition \\nand adjust your intake accordingly. \\n The menu plans do not give quantities for water or other \\ndrinks as the amount you need is quite individual and will \\nvary day to day according to the climate and your sweat rate. \\nCheck your hydration status with the ‘pee test’ (see page 61) \\nand ensure you drink sufficient fluids to maintain proper \\nhydration. \\n05bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   177 20/12/2013   14:15'),\n",

This ensures the body \\nhas enough time to empty the stomach and digest the \\nfood. Aim for 150–200 g of carbohydrate before a long \\nrace. For sprint races you may need only 75–150\\xa0g. Your \\nbreakfast can also contain a little fat and protein, e.g. \\neggs and milk. If you find it difficult to eat solid food \\nwhen you’re feeling nervous, try a liquid meal instead \\n(see page 147). Avoid bran and high-fibre cereals as \\nthey may loosen the stools and cause more bowel \\nmove ments than normal. \\n Starting the swim part of your race properly \\nhydrated is key to perfor mance, particularly for Olympic \\nand Ironman triathlons. Have 350–500 ml of water, \\ncordial, squash, a sports drink or diluted fruit juice \\n(1\\xa0part juice to 1–2 parts water) during the 2–4-hour period before the race. Swig \\nfrequently rather than drinking it in one go. The sodium naturally present in your \\nfood will also help the body hold on to fluid (which may be advantageous prior  \\nto a race when it’s important to avoid dehydration) so, despite the marketing \\nhype, there’s no need to consume a sports drink, i.e. a drink with sodium or \\nelectrolytes, beforehand. \\n Consuming a small carbohydrate-rich snack or drink about 1–2 hours before \\nthe start of the race will help maintain blood sugar levels.

In sprint triathlons the bike and run tend to be \\nrelatively flat so you can carry a bottle on your bike without adversely \\naffecting your time. Drink little and often according to thirst and sweat \\nrate. Two or three swigs at a time suits many triathletes. Stick to whatever \\nfluids you drank during your training. This should provide you with enough \\nenergy to see you through the 5-km run.\\n For longer events (more than 90 minutes), you will need to consume \\nextra carbohydrate in the form of sports drinks, energy gels, bars or fruit; \\nthese should be taken with sufficient water to maintain hydration and \\nblood sugar levels. Take advantage of the food served at the rest stops, but \\ndon’t eat anything you haven’t previously eaten in training. It is easier to \\neat and drink when you’re riding on the flat and in a straight line; climbing, \\ndescending and cornering demand your full concentration.\\n You may benefit from a sports drink containing sodium (electrolytes) \\nduring Olympic distance and Ironman triathlons when you’ll be competing \\nfor longer than 2 hours. The sodium helps the body retain fluid. For events \\nlonger than 3 hours, dual source sports drinks that supply a higher amount \\nof carbohydrate than regular isotonic drinks will help spare your muscle \\nglycogen stores and increase your endurance.\\nAfter the race\\nThe key to fast recovery is food and drink, so the sooner you eat and \\ndrink the better. Make sure you are rehydrated before embarking on a \\ncelebratory drink. You should drink about 500 ml of water, sports drink or \\nrecovery drink within the first 30 minutes of completing the event, then \\nkeep drinking small regular amounts until your urine is pale in colour. \\nIf you are dehydrated, a sports drink or diluted juice with a pinch of salt \\nadded will deliver fluid faster, and the sodium they contain will help \\nyour body retain the fluid better. Alternatively, opt for a recovery drink \\ncontaining carbohydrate and protein in a 3 to 1 ratio for speedy fuel and \\nmuscle recovery.\\n Eat a carbohydrate-rich snack within the first 30 minutes of completing \\nthe event, when blood flow to the muscles is greater and glycogen storage \\nis 1½ times faster than normal. This will help rebuild your glycogen stores. \\nSuitable post-race options include milk-based drinks, recovery drinks, \\ncheese or chicken sandwiches, yoghurt and flapjacks. \\nwHaT To eaT in THe saddle\\nn Energy bars, granola bars, flapjacks\\nn Gels\\nn Bananas \\nn Malt loaf or fruit cake\\nn Dried fruit\\nn Fig rolls\\nn Rice cakes\\nn Sandwiches\\nreCovery snaCks\\nn Bananas and yoghurt\\nn Flapjack or granola bars\\nn Fruit cake or malt loaf\\nn Sandwich with meat, chicken, fish, egg \\nor cheese \\nn Milk, flavoured milk, milkshake\\nn Dried fruit and nuts\\n05bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   185 20/12/2013   14:15'),\n",

Although you may not be running continuously, during a \\ngame lasting 60–90 minutes, you can easily deplete your leg-muscle \\nglycogen stores – more than enough to cause fatigue and dramatically \\nreduce running speeds. This chapter draws together the information \\nin Chapters 1–6 into a pre-match nutrition strategy and a match-day \\ntemplate to help you play well and stay on the winning side.   \\nFuel rules\\nA healthy daily diet helps your body adapt to the training you do, and ensures \\nthat you’re well fuelled for training and fast recovery. In a nutshell, you need \\ncarbohydrate to fuel working muscles, protein to promote training adaptations, \\nand high-quality fats necessary for health. \\n It’s difficult to give blanket recommendations for carbohydrate intake as \\ntype, intensity and duration of training vary greatly between different sports but, \\nas a rough guide, if you’re training hard for 1–2 hours daily you’ll need 5–7 g/\\nkg of body weight carbohydrate daily – that’s 350–490 g for a 70 kg person. If \\nyou’re training for less than 2 hours, then a slightly lower carbohydrate intake is \\nrecommended (3–5 g/kg). \\n There’s no need to consume anything other than water for resistance-based \\nsessions and/or shorter lower-intensity field sessions. But for hard field-based \\nsessions lasting more than one hour, consuming extra carbohydrate in the form \\nof squash, cordial, sports drinks, bananas or gels will help maintain training \\nintensity.\\n Immediately post-training, the timing of food intake is important. Consuming \\n20–25 g of protein post-resistance training will speed muscle repair and recovery. \\nAfter tough game-conditioning field-based sessions, combining this protein \\nwith 70–100 g of carbohydrate will also support a fast recovery process and \\n06bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   191 20/12/2013   14:17'),\n",

This allows \\nenough time for the food to empty from your stomach and get diges  ted so that \\nyour muscles can use the available fuel. Your pre-match meal should be high \\nin carbohydrate, but also contain some protein and fat to provide satiety and \\nsustained energy. Work on the basis of 25–50 g of carbo hydrate for each hour \\nbefore the start of the match, depending on your body weight and the match \\nduration. So that’s 100–200 g carbohydrate 4 hours beforehand or 25–50 g if you \\neat a snack (or drink) one hour before the match. \\n For morning matches, carbohydrate-rich foods such as porridge, cereal, toast \\nand fruit are good choices. Pasta with chicken or rice with fish would be suitable \\nmeals before an afternoon match. Aim for approximately 500–600 calories. \\nDuring the 2–4 hours before the match, drink approximately 350–500 ml of \\nwater, cordial, squash or a sports drink containing 6 g of carbohydrate/100 ml, or \\ndiluted fruit juice (equal parts juice and water). Take frequent swigs rather than \\ndowning it in one go as this promotes better fluid retention.

Many scientific studies have shown \\nthat a vegetarian diet can meet the needs of competitive athletes (Craig et  \\nal., 2009). \\n A review of studies on vegetarian athletes concluded that well-planned and \\nvaried vegetarian diets don’t hinder athletic potential and do indeed support \\nathletic performance (Barr and Rideout, 2004). Several studies have found no \\nsignificant differences in performance, physical fitness (aerobic or anaerobic \\ncapacities), limb circumference and strength between vegetarian and non-\\nvegetarian athletes (Williams, 1985). \\n In a German study, runners completed a 1,000-km race after consuming either \\na vegetarian or non-vegetarian diet containing similar amounts of carbohydrate \\n(60 per cent energy) (Eisinger, 1994). There was no difference in performance \\nbetween the vegetarians and the non-vegetarians.\\n Together, these studies suggest that a vegetarian diet, even when followed \\nfor several decades, is compatible with successful athletic performance. \\n06bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   199 20/12/2013   14:17'),\n",

If you don’t eat meat \\nor fish, then you need to ensure that you include some protein with each meal. \\nVegetarian sources include dairy products, eggs, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, grains, \\nsoya and QuornTM. The proteins in dairy products and eggs are all high quality \\n(i.e. they provide a good balance of essential amino acids), but plant sources are \\nlimiting in one or more essential amino acids. The idea is to eat a combination of \\nproteins so that the shortfall of amino acids in one food (e.g. lysine in cereals) is \\ncomplemented by the higher amounts found in another (e.g. beans or lentils). So, \\nrice with lentils (or even beans on toast) would provide a perfect profile of amino \\nacids. \\n The key is to include a variety of different protein foods throughout the day \\nin order to get a better overall balance of amino acids. This is called ‘protein \\ncomplementation’ . For example, combining rice with lentils gives a better overall \\nratio of amino acids needed to make new body proteins than eating either of these \\nfoods on their own. You can achieve protein com plementation by combining \\nplant foods from two or more of the following categories:\\n06bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   200 20/12/2013   14:17'),\n",

Many do not substitute suitable foods in place of \\nmeat and fail to consume enough protein and other nutrients to support their \\ntraining.\\niron and zinc\\nOmitting meat may result in lower intakes of iron and zinc and, theoretically, an \\nincreased risk of iron-deficiency anaemia. However, there is evidence that the \\nbody adapts over time by increasing the percentage of minerals it absorbs from \\nfood. Lowered levels of iron and zinc in the diet result in increased absorption. \\n Despite iron from plants being less readily absorbed, research has shown that \\niron-deficiency anaemia is no more common in vege  tarians than in meat eaters. \\nEven among female endurance athletes, vegetarians are not at greater risk of \\niron deficiency. Researchers have found that blood levels of haemoglobin and \\nrunning performance are very similar between non-vegetarian and vegetarian \\nfemale runners. \\n Eating vitamin C-rich food (e.g. fruit and vegetables) at the same time as iron-\\nrich foods greatly improves iron absorption. Citric acid (found naturally in fruit \\nand vegetables) and amino acids also promote iron absorption. Good sources of \\niron for vegetarians include wholegrain cereals, wholemeal bread, nuts, pulses, \\ngreen vegetables (broccoli, watercress and spinach), fortified cereals, seeds and \\ndried fruit. Table 12.2 shows the iron content of various vegetarian foods. \\n The absorption of zinc and other trace minerals, such as copper, manganese \\nand selenium, can be reduced by bran and other plant compounds (phytates, \\noxalic acid), but most studies have failed to show that vegetarians have lower \\nblood levels of these minerals. Whole grains, pulses, nuts, seeds and eggs are \\ngood sources of zinc. \\nomega-3s\\nOily fish are rich in long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, so vegetarians who don’t eat \\nfish will need to obtain them from other foods.

You \\nshould talk to your healthcare team for more information.\\nWhat is the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes?\\nType 1 diabetes is a condition where the body is unable to produce any insulin \\nand is therefore unable to use glucose properly as a fuel source. It starts to rely on \\nfat and protein as fuel. This means blood glucose levels can rise excessively and \\ntoxic by-products from fat metabolism (ketones) can build up in the blood. Type \\n1 diabetes is treated with regular insulin injections, diet and physical activity. It \\nusually affects people under 40. \\n Type 2 diabetes develops when the body can still make some insulin, but not \\nenough, or when the insulin that is produced does not work properly (insulin \\nresistance). It is usually associated with being overweight and is found mostly in \\nadults – although more children are being diagnosed with the condition. It can \\nbe treated with diet and physical activity, although you may also need tablets or \\ninjections. \\nCan diabetes be treated? \\nType 1 diabetes is treated by insulin injections as well as a healthy\\xa0diet, and regular \\nexercise. People with this type of diabetes usually take two or four injections of \\ninsulin each day.\\xa0 \\n Type 2 diabetes is treated with lifestyle changes such as a healthier diet, \\nweight loss and increased physical activity.

This, together with a \\nhealthy lifestyle, will help to improve your diabetes and protect against long-term \\ndamage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart and major arteries.\\nWhat dietary changes do I need to make?\\nEating a low-GI diet can help with blood glucose control so you should focus \\nmainly on low-GI foods (see page 14) and combinations of foods that produce a \\nlow glycaemic (blood glucose) response. Foods with a high protein content (e.g. \\nmeat, fish, eggs, cheese, yoghurt, milk) and a high fat content (e.g. nuts, seeds, \\nbutter, olives, avocado, olive and coconut oils) have the lowest GI. When they are \\neaten with carbohydrate (e.g. cheese on toast) they will reduce the overall GI of \\nthe dish. For further information about low-GI diets, you should speak to your \\ndiabetes specialist or dietitian.\\n The sports nutrition advice is similar for diabetics and non-diabetics, particu -\\nlarly with regard to nutrient timing, recovery and hydration. You should follow the \\nadvice in this book, but you may need to experiment with the amount and timing \\nof foods and fluids around exercise to achieve perfect blood glucose control. It’s \\na good idea to keep a training and food diary so you can monitor how your body \\nresponds to exercise. You should consult your diabetes specialist if you have any \\nconcerns. \\nBefore exercise\\nYou’ll need to get into the routine of monitoring your blood glucose before \\nexercise. It is important to ensure your blood glucose level is within the recom-\\nmended range (usually 4–8 mmol/l or 80–120 mg/dl) before you begin exercising. \\nIf it is below this range, you should consume a snack containing 15–30 g carbo-\\nhydrate (e.g. a banana). If it is above this range, then it could climb even higher \\nonce you start exercising, which can be dangerous, so wait until it comes down. \\n As with non-diabetics, aim to have a low-GI meal about 2–4 hours before \\nexercise. A low-GI meal will not only help avoid problems of high blood glucose \\nlevels but may also improve your endurance. It will produce a lower rise in blood \\nglucose. Ideally, this meal should include protein and fat as well as carbohydrate \\nas they slow the digestion of carbohydrate and produce a more gradual rise in \\nblood glucose. Include fruit or vegetables in this meal as their high fibre content \\nwill also slow the delivery of carbohydrate to your bloodstream and avoid rapid \\nrises in blood glucose. Suitable pre-exercise meals include porridge with fruit (for \\nmorning workouts), chicken with rice, or pasta with fish. \\n06bFFF_9781472901996_txt.indd   206 20/12/2013   14:17'),\n",

Ensure that you replace fluids as soon as practical after exercise, \\nand if you will be exercising within 24 hours, then consume a carbohydrate/\\nprotein snack within 2 hours to speed recovery. However, the body cells are more \\nsensitive to insulin for several hours after exercise and glycogen is replenished \\nmore rapidly, so there is a greater risk of delayed hypoglycaemia during this time. \\nEating a small carbohydrate-based snack (e.g. a banana or dried fruit) may help \\nreduce this risk but you should monitor your blood glucose levels carefully. Check \\nyour blood glucose levels – you may also need to reduce your insulin dose. \\nThe gluten-free athlete\\nA gluten-free diet is the treatment for coeliac disease. This is an autoimmune \\ncondition, which means the body’s immune system attacks its own tissues. In \\npeople with coeliac disease this immune reaction is triggered by\\xa0a protein, gluten. \\nGluten damages the surface of the intestines and reduces the body’s ability to \\nabsorb nutrients from food. There is no cure for coeliac disease, but switching to \\na gluten-free diet prevents further damage to the lining of your intestines and \\nallows your gut to heal. \\n If you have been diagnosed with this condition, then you must avoid gluten \\nin all its various forms. However, this can present an extra challenge for athletes \\nwith high carbohydrate requirements as many staple foods contain gluten: bread, \\npasta and most breakfast cereals. It can also be difficult getting enough fibre and \\niron. It is important to make sure\\xa0your gluten-free diet is healthy and balanced. \\nWhat is gluten and how do I avoid it?\\nGluten is a type of protein found in wheat, barley and rye. Many people think \\nthey simply need to cut wheat from their diets – or even just bread – in order to \\ngo gluten-free. But it’s unfortunately a lot more complicated than that. Gluten \\nappears in pasta, cakes, breakfast cereals and bread as well as many processed \\nfoods such as soups, sauces, sausages, ready meals, cakes, biscuits and puddings. \\n There are many basic foods, such as meat, fish, eggs, fruit, vegetables, cheese, \\npotatoes and rice, which are naturally gluten-free so you can still include them in \\nyour diet. You can also buy gluten free products, including pasta, pizza bases and \\nbread, in supermarkets and health food shops. If you’re just starting a gluten-free \\ndiet, you should consult a dietitian who can help you identify which foods are safe \\nto eat and which are not.
