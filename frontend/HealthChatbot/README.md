# Nutrional-Health-chatbot
The End-to-End Medical Chatbot Project leverages generative AI to create a user-friendly chatbot capable of providing medical advice and information. Users can input medical queries, such as symptoms or conditions, and receive relevant suggestions regarding diagnosis, treatments, and medications based on a curated knowledge base. The chatbot integrates a large language model to generate accurate and context-aware responses.

Technologies Used
Large Language Model (LLM): OpenAI's models for generating conversational responses.
LangChain: A framework to facilitate the development of the chatbot functionality.
Pinecone: A cloud-based vector database for storing and retrieving the chatbot's medical knowledge using vector embeddings.
Flask: A Python web framework for building the user interface and handling requests.
Python: The primary programming language for developing the backend logic and embedding processes.
